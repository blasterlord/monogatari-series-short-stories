It seems like I had forgotten about what kind of personality Araragi Tsukihi had. Even if I had, let’s see, gotten careless after winning (?) against Kagenui-san and Yotsugi-chan in our battle, as everyone who’s listened to the anime CD dramas must know,

“At the end of the summer holiday, I want to introduce my girlfriend to you.”

is something I should never have said no matter what to my little sister with her personality. Especially knowing there’s no way she’d wait until the end of the summer holiday if I told her anyway.

“How long.”

Tsukihi said.

She had me kneeling on the floor of her room as she asked me. More importantly, she had her arms crossed in a terrifying pose looking over me.

“How long were you planning to wait to tell me that.”

“Well, how long…”

She was terrifying.

As to what exactly was so terrifying, my little sister was already holding an awl in one hand. You better hurry up and put that back in the toolbox or they’ll start selling it in a set with your figurine.

Of course, that awl may as well have been a toy after fighting against Kagenui-san. The problem wasn’t the awl, but the fact that my little sister was holding it and standing over me with her arms crossed itself was terrifying.

And the fact that Tsukihi was poking her own arm with the sharp end of the awl also was a bit scary. She was just scraping against the skin so there was no blood, but I could feel the pressure radiating from her just looking at her “Can you tell that I’m annoyed now” sort of pose.

“You had a girlfriend? The hell were you thinking taking my first kiss when you had a girlfriend?”

“You should watch your language Tsukihi-chan. You’re a girl so you should be a bit gentler with your words or people will look at you funny.”

“O brother of mine, how durst you have been to place your lips against mine and take my first kiss, when there is already another woman who waits for you.”

“…”

Durst you have been? That doesn’t quite sound right.

I wanted to tell her that, but I would probably end up with an awl stuck in my eyeball if I did. No choice, I decided to ignore it.

“I’m not sure that really counts as ‘gentle’…”

“You takie my fiwst kish?”

“Fiwst kish.”

Hearing her trying to sound cute made me even more afraid of the awl… Wow, awls sure are something.

It seems like they can just take any sort of character and completely overwrite it… Of course awls should only be used the way they were supposed to.

“Let me think, are you supposed to use them to chip off ice to put in your whiskey?”

“That’s an icepick. Don’t mix them up.”

“They look almost the same though…”

Don’t mix them up with a gimlet either.

“About the same as somen and cold noodles.”

“How long.”

Tsukihi must have realized I was intentionally saying something she could easily comment on to try and change the flow of the conversation, so she forced it back.

“How long were you planning to wait to tell me that.”

“W—Well, you see, I was planning to tell you by the end of summer holiday… I mean, tomorrow! I was going to tell you tomorrow. Come on, Tsukihi-chan, you just had to ask about it. You ruined the surprise party I was planning.”

“You were going to have a surprise party to tell us you had a girlfriend… Do you think you’re some celebrity? Oniichan.”

Ha, Tsukihi-chan mocked me.

That wasn’t cute.

“I bet you just told me because it happened to slip out or you just felt like it and by tomorrow you won’t even remember you promised to tell me.”

“I—Isn’t that a bit prejudiced… Have I ever broken a promise with you?”

“I don’t think you’ve ever kept one of your promises. Or kept your little sister safe.”

“I have kept you safe before!”

I just did today!

I did everything I could today to protect you, I even died a few times… But it would be hard to tell her that here and now.

“Have you? When was it? When was it? What time, what minute, what second, whatchamacallit, how many times did the Earth spin?”

“Guh…”

It’s so frustrating!

Why can’t I even win an argument against her!

“When did you even start dating? And when did you start keeping that a secret from me? Didn’t we decide we wouldn’t keep any secrets between us anymore?”

“I’m pretty sure we aren’t two kids who made that promise while supporting each other as the only people we have left to depend on after our parents died…”

After putting that out there, I said

“Since Mother’s Day.”

“Mother’s Day? Hahahahahahahaha!”

Tsukihi burst into laughter.

Because it’s Mother’s Day, so “hahahahahahaha”.[^1] 

That wasn’t even funny, and that laugh made me shudder.

“I see, I see. So after you had that fight with Karen-chan you ran out of the house, and while the whole Araragi family couldn’t even look each other in the eye, you were out there picking up some chick?”

“ ‘Picking up a chick’…”

Couldn’t you have put it in a nicer way?

Actually, why are you saying “the whole Araragi family”?

I’m part of the family too you know.

“What? That’s what you were doing isn’t it? On Mother’s Day of all days, on that day of celebration that only comes around once a year, when we were supposed to be showing our mom our gratitude, you were flirting with some girl weren’t you? You chose some young girl over your family.”

“I can’t believe what a bad kid you turned out to be…”

‘Some young girl’? Well she is young.

She’s in the same grade as me so she’d be 18.

“I bet Karen-chan’s going to be so disappointed when she hears this. She was so happy because she thought you’d actually grown up a little after you apologized to her, but it turns out you were so careless because you were happy you got yourself a girlfriend.”

“How would you know I didn’t care? Don’t just decide that for me!”

“It was a celebration but you turned it into a carelebration instead.”[^2]

“Damn it…”

She thinks she can just say whatever pops into her head because she’s holding an awl.

“So since then you’ve been keeping us in the dark about it the whole time? During breakfast and dinner, you never told me that you had a girlfriend. You were just thinking about how much better the food tasted knowing that I was completely in the dark about your girlfriend and secretly laughing at me in your head weren’t you.”

“Do you really think that there’s an older brother out there who would do that?”

“You! You nonexistent big brother! How could you keep a secret from me! I knew it, you haven’t been wrestling with us when we fight because you’re saving yourself for your girlfriend!”

“It’s not like I wrestle with her anyway… And besides, even if I was just careless because I was happy, it’s because I met a fifth-grade girl, not because I got a girlfriend.”

“How long!”

Was the gist of the conversation as Tsukihi kept asking me about my girlfriend all the way until the morning.

[^1]: The Japanese word for “mother” (母) is pronounced haha.

[^2]: Tsukihi previously called Koyomi “careless” (おざなり, ozanari). Here, she says オザーナリー (ozaanarii) to make it sound like アニバーサリー (anibaasarii, “anniversary”).
