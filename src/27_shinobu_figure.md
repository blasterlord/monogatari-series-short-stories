To me, Oshino Shinobu is a special existence.

So very special that she is more like a part of my body—of course, it is not that she is a part of my body; it is more like I’m a part of her body; no matter which, we are one in body and soul, and as inseparable as two sides of a coin, with advantages and disadvantages to it; we have a bond that will not be broken.

Leaving out all the details of how it came to be that way, it will suffice to say that for Araragi Koyomi, the little blond girl, the little girl yet an enchantress, Oshino Shinobu is in various ways and in every way more important than his own heart. That much is certain.

Still, no matter how indispensable a presence she may be, it cannot be said that it would be good if there was suddenly more than one of her—so, what I want to say is, one day, suddenly, there were two Shinobus.

Standing next to each other, quietly, in the same pose.

This silent atmosphere where she is just looking at me is making me think fondly that, if only that hat she’s wearing was a helmet, it would be like how she used to sit quietly in the corner of that cram school hugging her knees—though having said that, this is not the time to be thinking fondly about the past.

“Huh, the number of Shinobus has increased to two? What is this situation?”

“Calm down, Devilish Big Brother. One of them is just an image of the other—as one of them is the Nendoroid made by Good Smile Company.”

Ononoki-chan was by my side as though it was normal, the shikigami girl Ononoki Yotsugi-chan, said that in an expressionless intonation.

“Wha—WHHAAAATTTT? One of them is a Nendoroid made by Good Smile Company!?”

It can’t be, no matter how much I compare them I can’t spot any differences.

Even I, who is a “Oshino Shinobu professional”, cannot tell which is the real one and which is the figure.

No matter how much I narrow my eyes and look at them, I cannot say anything but that they are exactly the same.

Though I had heard rumors of it, what a fearsome Nendoroid, what a frightening reproduction!

“If such goods are being sold, people will be compelled to buy it… I told that to Good Smile”

“This is fine, Devilish Big Brother. If it’s you, you can surely tell which is the real one.”

Ononoki-chan patted me on the back with all her strength, to encourage me—the heartless way she used so much strength to hit me in the back might be an expression of anger due to the olden ways of speaking she has been used to.

“For you, Devilish Big Brother, the former Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, that is, Oshino Shinobu is a special loli existence, right?”[^1]

“Special! What is a special loli? Don’t notice the fact that ‘loli’ is included in ‘special’.[^2] It will make it difficult to use the word ‘special’ from now on, won’t it? How frequently used a word do you think it is? Will saying ‘it doesn’t matter’ now become ‘loli doesn’t matter’? Will ‘extraordinary’ become ‘every loli’?[^3] What does it mean?”

Hmm, I looked at the two Shinobus again—the identical Shinobus just stayed silent and didn’t move a muscle.

It’s really like her early character.

I see, they truly are the splitting image of each other—still, for each situation there is a different approach to use.

Anyhow, as this is only a short story; as more than twenty volumes of the story have passed, this story’s setting will also fit into that so that it can be read with it.

“Ku ku ku…”

I laughed fearlessly like that.

Perhaps, all of this is a bad trick being played on me by Ononoki-chan and Shinobu together (though the vampire and the zombie have a bad relationship with each other, when the goal is to play a trick on me they become little girls who join hands), and it’s all the worse for their opponent.

Maybe it is that kind of setting, or an obligatory dramaturgy—in a story like this, there is a possibility that both Shinobus are dolls.

And while I’m trying to guess correctly, the real one will appear behind me. I’m sure this is the setting, but unfortunately for them, I’m one step ahead of them.

“To think you’ve bought two Good Smile Company Nendoroids just to surprise me… Well, the quality is such that it makes you think there are two Shinobus, I won’t deny that.”

“The sales talk has gone for too long now, Devilish Big Brother.”

“Which is it?”

Saying that, I reached out with both my hands towards both the figures—no matter how similar they look, there’s no way that they could have reproduced how Shinobu’s skin feels.

That is, if I touch and see, I’ll be able to find the answer—really, this is too easy that I feel I’m being teased.

Well, for a student who’s preparing for his entrance exams, this has been a stimulating event—as it was fun for me, as a reward I might even buy some of her favorite donuts.

And while thinking such generous thoughts, I struck my hand into their one-piece dress from the back…

“Uhyauu!?”

“Uhyauu!?”

The both of them screamed at the same time.

“What?”

What?

Can a figure yell?

“How are you touching me, you idiot? Don’t rub my back!”

“How are you touching me, you idiot? Don’t rub my back!”

“Vampire Punch!”

“Vampire Punch!”

I received two vampire punches at the same time.

An uppercut to the jaw, which is one of the five vital points in the human body, has a quite fatal destructive force by itself; to take two of those punches is not a simple thing—unable to bear it, I was blown back.

With minimal movement, Ononoki-chan moved out of the way as I was blown back. Why are you moving away, you should support me as I fall!

“Wha—what…?”

As I was rubbing my head and descending into total confusion, I noticed that both figures were teary-eyed in battle mode, breathing heavily and glaring at me.

It was not only the shout, but also the feeling under my two palms right before that, and the spines that I felt through their skin!

“You got caught, didn’t you, Devilish Big Brother? The punch line of the trick this time was that both are real.”

“As if someone could understand something like that!”

“She became two using her vampire powers.”

“Can she do something like that?!”

This vampire power, it’s just too powerful, isn’t it?

“Ka ka.”

“Ka ka.”

Maybe it was the disgraceful sight of me panicking—the two Shinobus dropped their fighting stances and laughed together.

“It is a simple thing. If you are an iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire like me.”

“It is a simple thing. If you are an iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire like me.”

“A… Amazing.”

Hmmm… There’s nothing to do but admire her.

Wait, you can perform time-slips, you can multiply, though you say it is a vampire power, right now you are not a vampire or anything.

If she can do all that, she could have used them in the problems we faced… Why use it to play tricks?

Was she unwilling to use it or not…

“Ca—Can I also do something like that?”

“To have two of you, what sort of hell is that? Who wrote that sort of a scene? Just die.”

While I was being scolded severely like that by Ononoki-chan (did I say something so bad that I deserve to die for it?), the two Shinobus changed the subject as a duo saying “by the way, you” “by the way, you”—though it was as a duo, it was the exact same tone.

It seems like, in the near future, I will be feeling an inexpressible and bottomless uneasiness.

“This… How do I go back to being one again?”

“This… How do I go back to being one again?”

“… So that’s the punch line.”

And so.

The little blond girl who is a very special existence to me; became two—maybe the figure in your hands is also a real one who has become unable to turn back.

[^1]: Instead of saying 特別 (tokubetsu, “special”), Ononoki says 特ロリ (tokuloli) which Araragi runs with.

[^2]: The characters for “loli” (ロリ) are included in the kanji for “special” (別).

[^3]: Here, Araragi transforms 別 into ロリ in the phrases 別にいいです(betsuni ii desu, “it doesn’t matter”) and 別格 (bekkaku, “extraordinary”).
