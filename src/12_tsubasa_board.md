In the final volume of his four-part Odyssey Series, 3001: The Final Odyssey, Arthur C. Clarke defines an “intellectual” as such: “someone who has been educated beyond their intelligence”. As someone who has lived her entire life cramming knowledge and information into her body just as someone who is starving seeks to live, when I read this definition for the first time, it felt as if my own name were called out. Without a doubt.

Receiving an education isn’t necessarily a good thing, nor is having knowledge. Only “knowing” something is exactly the same as not knowing it.

“No, sometimes knowing too much might be a far greater disadvantage, Hanekawa-san. Hanekawa Tsubasa-san. When you’re bound by superficial knowledge, you can’t do anything. That doesn’t happen to most people”, Senjougahara said in response to my lead-in.

“That said, we live in an information-overloaded society. If you try asking one thing you’ll be taught ten;[^1] you’ll be taught things you don’t even want to know. These days, the right to teach others is valued even more than the right to learn, and we have a system where no one is allowed to live in ignorance and indifference. No one even cares about me personally, the information just keeps flooding in. I can’t stand all the little tips the world feels like it has to give.” Senjougahara continued, seemingly overwhelmed.

Once a schemer fell for his own scheme, but I think these days intellectuals fall for knowledge.[^2] There’s no need to even make schemes, knowledge jumbles together just like them.

“You’re right, but even so, you probably can’t cut off information entirely, Senjougahara-san. Of course, all we can do is keep a mental kickboard to keep ourselves from drowning in knowledge.”

“A kickboard… Grasping at straws when you’re drowning is certainly unreliable,[^3] but I don’t know… For someone like me, it seems like carrying a kickboard full of teeth marks.”

Senjougahara said something I don’t understand very well—I wonder if it means something like “being impatient” and “grinding your teeth”? Or, it could be that Senjougahara wants to say that the “breaks” should be put on the influx—the torrent of knowledge. She has the strength to shut the world out. It’s a dangerous strength, but it is a strength. There’s no room for doubt about that.

“Speaking of boards, Hanekawa-san, the monolith that appears in 3001: The Final Odyssey gave intelligence to humanity, didn’t it? It gave us intelligence and made us evolve.”

“Yep. But the monolith itself isn’t either good or bad. It seems neither intelligence nor information have any meaning for it, either.”

“In the long run, it’s a problem, isn’t it, Hanekawa-san. Once we know something, it means that that we can’t not know it. Living things can’t run against evolution. We can’t expel the intelligence that we’ve been infused with from our bodies. We’d burst if we tried.”

The wish, “I want to live without knowing”, won’t be realized.

For better or for worse.

We’re forced to grow to that extent.

“Well… There’s nothing convenient like if you could eliminate the knowledge and information you thought you didn’t need from your memory once and for all. But, I think you’re right. Rather than running against or flowing against something, it’s proactive degeneration, and rather than being a recession it’s a decline.”

“…”

“What’s wrong, Senjougahara-san? You suddenly clammed up.”

“No, nothing’s wrong. There’s nothing wrong. Nothing at all. But without a doubt, that body of yours might be too stuffed with knowledge”, Senjougahara said.

Without even trying to hide her genuine amazement.

“Most people wouldn’t even know that 2001: A Space Odyssey has three sequels. Hanekawa-san, you really do know everything, don’t you.”

Taking Senjougahara’s cue, I answered like I always do.

“I don’t know everything; I just know what I know.”

[^1]: Hanekawa is playing off of the Japanese expression 一を聞いて十を知る (ichi wo kiite juu wo shiru, “ask one (thing) and know ten”).

[^2]: Hanekawa is referring to the Japanese expression 策士、策に溺れる (sakushi, saku ni oboreru, “a schemer falls for his own schemes”).

[^3]: Senjougahara is playing off of the expression 溺れる者はわらをもつかむ (oboreru mono ha wara wo mo katsumu, “a drowning man will even grasp at straws”).
