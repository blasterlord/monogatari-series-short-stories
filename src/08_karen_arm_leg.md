Araragi Karen is quite tall. In the sense that she was simply tall, without needing any sort of explanation or sidenote added such as “for a girl”, or “for someone in ninth grade” or even “compared to her brother”, she was just tall. And even scarier than the most terrifying ghost stories is the fact that even now she’s still growing. Setting aside these feelings of terror and fear, these emotional problems, and investigating the “condition” of her height, logically thinking it follows that both her legs and arms are quite long as well.

Like the two youkai, Tenaga and Ashinaga.[^1] 

I was a bit traumatized when I saw a program about old legends in Japan as a kid. And Araragi Karen could be called a physical embodiment of the two youkai in one. You could say it boils down to her having long arms and legs, but now she was swinging those rather long arms and legs around wildly.

“Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”

She shouted and cried out.

Spread out on the floor like she was making a snow angel.

She swung her limbs around to their fullest extent and writhed on the floor. “Writhed” might have been a more eloquent way of putting it, but in fact it sounded more like “bang” or “crush” or “snap snap snap”, sounds of various things being broken. With every flailing of her arms and every kick of her legs, something else would break.

It was like the coming of a great god of destruction.

I assure you that I’m not exaggerating at all, but if it still feels like this is all an exaggeration, I would dare to put it this way even if it isn’t quite true. Simply speaking.

Araragi Karen.

My little sister was having a temper tantrum now.

And a huge one at that.

“S—Stop it already, Karen-chan! Karen-chan, calm down!”

But my words would never reach her.

Actually, they probably did, but they had the opposite of the intended effect of calming her down, and she in fact began shouting and worked herself into a greater rage as if to block out my voice.

“You’re lying to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! You have to be lying to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”

Bang.

Crush.

Snap snap snap.

This was all taking place in the living room of the Araragi house, in other words one of the most important facilities of a house. However, Karen paid no attention to that and went on breaking things, and more things, and more things.

Those long arms and legs like a youkai weren’t to be taken lightly.

I could still look on the bright side and say that at least this hadn’t happened a bit earlier, or else the living room would have faced the added destruction of her ponytail as well.

“C—Calm down Karen-chan. Come on, stop crying, stop shouting, stop throwing things around. You’re already in your last year of middle school, next year you’ll be in high school. You’re acting like a kid crying over some dropped ice crea—guha”

I was thrown back by Karen’s fist, more accurately her backhand, as I tried my best to stop her from struggling.

That punch might have been fatal if I didn’t have the increased healing factor from my vampirism. I was pretty lucky that I had just let Shinobu suck some of my blood too.

Man, being immortal really is convenient.

I won’t even die from my little sister’s tantrums.

“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa”

“ ‘Waaaaaaaaaa’? Have you ever heard anyone cry like that outside a manga?”

“It’s a lie!”

She hadn’t exactly calmed down, but since the start of her tantrum it was the first time anything resembling speech had come out of Karen’s mouth.

“It’s a lie! There’s no way you have a girlfriend, oniichan! I don’t believe it! I’m never believing it! You’d never get a girlfriend!”

“……”

“You’re my oniichan! You don’t need a girlfriend! You were just going to live alone for the rest of your life!”

Wait a second.

What do you mean alone for the rest of my life.

“Waaaaaaaaaa! You betrayed me! You were my oniichan and only mine! It was just the two of us, brother and sister!”

Karen quickly brushed off Tsukihi’s very existence.

I’d like you to understand that’s how agitated she was right now.

And I think you understand the situation now.

Near the end of summer holiday.

I turned to Karen and, like I told Tsukihi, told her

“You know there’s actually this girl I’ve been dating since a little while ago.”

And before I could say “I’ll introduce her to you when we get a chance” Karen crushed (!?) the dumbbell she had been training with up until a moment ago with a bored look on her face, opened her eyes as wide as they would go and immediately flipped over the sofa she was sitting on as if to crush it to bits.

And with those two arms and legs.

She unleashed her two arms and legs which were long like the Amazon river and started throwing a tantrum.

“Break up with her! Break up with her! Break up with her right now!”

“You sure ask for a lot…”

“Call her right now and break up with her! I’ll call her if you can’t! I’ll tell her you can’t go out with her anymore because you love your little sister so much!”

“Damn she’s scary…”

I’d never seen this kind of little sister character before.

Araragi Karen used to be the classic example of the “real life little sisters aren’t that cute” character. And that had now reached its peak.

What kind of crazy fantasy has a little sister who would make her brother break up with his girlfriend.

“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! How could you get a girlfriend, oniichan! And you kept it a secret from me!”

“This reaction was way more than I expected…”

I guess for all how much she’s trained her body, she completely neglected to train her mind… So she kept on destroying the floor of the Araragi household.

I was ready to get punched, but I never expected her to cry and throw a tantrum…

“Tell me what I’m doing wrong!”

Karen sat up suddenly and glared at me. Her face was covered in tears.

“If it was something to do with sex why didn’t you just do it with me!”

“What the hell, that’s scary! What she says and what she thinks!”

“I can’t believe you already had a girlfriend when you were brushing my teeth like that!”

“I know how people bring that up a lot, but if you really think about it, it was perfectly wholesome, just a brother helping his little sister brush her teeth!”

“Let me see her! Let me see your girlfriend!”

Karen said, choking back her tears.

While still wildly flailing her limbs around.

“I’m going to brush her teeth! I’m going to brush them till they’re sparkling clean! I’m going to make sure she knows that I’m the only one allowed to have her teeth brushed by you!”

“…”

Whatever.

You are actually the only person whose teeth I’ve brushed—in any case.

That was how I became the mediator between Senjougahara and Karen. I don’t care what happens afterwards, whether they bring a building down or cause a landslide, although considering they are the Fire Sisters, it’s more like whether they burn a building down or start a forest fire.

Karen’s tantrums continued on after that.

And all there was to do was patiently wait for them to end.
