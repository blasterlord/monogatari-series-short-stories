If you picked

## Nekomonogatari Kuro

_Cat_

You got some pretty good luck. Cats tend to stay close to humans, but keep a certain distance so they’re not very consistent. However, if dogs are man’s best friend, cats simply exist alongside humanity. Staying close but not too close is a purrfectly fine way to live.

If you picked

## Bakemonogatari II

_Lion_

Apparently, some people like to point out that Aries and Taurus are particularly masculine signs. But what’s the point of that? For lions, the males have majestic manes while lionesses have sleek bodies. You’re cool the way you are so you should just stay that way. Did something good happen to mew recently?

If you picked

## Nisemonogatari II

_Lynx_

There are endangered species of wildcats out there. They’re in big trouble so you better help them out. Don’t think you can selfishly live your own life! I will say that “lynx” has a nice ring to it and I’m super jealous. Nyaturally, I expect you to be cool enough to live up to such a name.

If you picked

## Hanamonogatari

_Cheetah_

Everyone thinks cheetahs are the fastest ever, but that may not be the case. They can go all out for a split second, but they tire quickly. Well, no one does it better than the king of instant speed at least. So make sure mew make the most out of that speed. Be quick and decisive. People mostly deal with the short term so take advantage of that.

If you picked

## Otorimonogatari

_Liger_

Half lion and half tiger. They are a human creation so I find that a bit troubling if you ask me. Then again, dogs and cats are products of selective breeding. Well, I’ll make sure you have good luck with money so think of it like I’m praying for you. Just don’t go thinking that’ll be enough meow.

If you picked

## Nisemonogatari I

_Rose-gold pussy willow_

So you’re a plant. Quite a few plants take their names from cats but purrsonally I think the way willows softly sway in the wind makes them most like them. Now, I want you to face the rough waves of society with the same flexibility. Or let them flow past you even. As long as your will doesn’t break, you can get through anything, no matter what.

If you picked

## Nekomonogatari Shiro

_Tiger_

Watch out for fire! Be careful around it! It’s hot! You’ll get burned! And beware of a certain katana, too! You’ll have no idea when it’ll come slicing down from the sky! By the way, white tigers are tigers, but black tigers are a kind of shrimp. The more mew know.

If you picked

## Bakemonogatari I

_Black-tailed gull_

I know gulls are birds, but they “meow” like cats so it’s close enough. How amewsing is it that while wildcats are cats, “sea cats” are actually birds? Why not call them “sky cats” then? Anyway, make sure people don’t get your name wrong. There’s never a time to let others mess up your name. On the other paw, don’t be getting other people’s names wrong yourself.

If you picked

## Koimonogatari

_Cougar_

When it comes down to cougars, they have a “womanly” vibe, don’t you think? Having picked such a sexy cat, you must be in love. Nyot that I’m in any pawsition to even talk about love. I guess I’ll just keep an eye on you.

If you picked

## Kabukimonogatari

_Panda_

Before you go thinking what pandas have to do with cats, bears are also part of Carnivora. So that means panda bears are part of the same order. And get this, they are one of the few species that are herbivores. All they snack on are bamboo. This makes me more worried about them going extinct over wildcats. But, like, don’t they have the coolest camouflage? It’s the purrfect ratio of black and white.

If you picked

## Kizumonogatari

_Fishing cat_

This may seem obvious from their name, and this is really a minor point, but fishing cats hunt fur fish. The belief that all cats are fish lovers is a little misleading really. The only cats that go out of their way to catch fish are these guys. Watch yourself around water now. In the end, despite their name, fishing really isn’t that big of a deal.

If you picked

## Onimonogatari

_Leopard seal_

Anyather one for the Carnivora order. Purretty broad, huh? They’re called “leopard seals”. Who do you think would win in a fight between leopard of the sea and leopard of the land? Nyaturally, the leopard seal would if it was in water and the leopard on the ground. But don’t you think “sea leopard” sounds cool? Like a terrifying beast of the sea. Anyway, these horoscopes are just excuses and have no bearing on your fortune. Your fate is all up to you.
