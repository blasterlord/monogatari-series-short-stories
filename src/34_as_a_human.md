At nearly the same time that my servant went off to fetch the braided rations,[^1] as calmly as if they had only just missed each other, and as suddenly as slipping through a gap, Guillotine Cutter made his appearance.

“What is this? Were thou not to wait for us?”

“I was astonished—astonished with the foolish exchanges of a demon and a human.”

So he said, and then as if thinking better, “though both were demons”, and shrugged his shoulders.

Apparently he really was astonished.

“I suppose even the boy’s barrier is not something capable of containing me at my full power, ka ka. Of course that is only natural. So then, what hast thou come to do? Or, hast thou come to die?[^2] Thou hast suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of my servant and were utterly routed, were thou not?”

“I dare say as far as God is concerned, I was defeated; as far as humans are concerned, I have not lost. Not to you. And not to you. Or perhaps not to you. And while I’m at it, not to you.”[^3]

Guillotine Cutter quickly drew close to me.

I like his fearlessness.

“Of course… Not to that child either.”

“… Dost thou intend revenge? Stop, stop, after all, ‘tis but a game. That’s right. It is as thou hast said, it is not appropriate to decide victory in this matter with such games.”

If I presume to say, Guillotine Cutter did lose to the boy.

I suppose Dramaturgy, Episode, and Guillotine Cutter were taken in by the boy’s arrangements… Hmm.

Though I’m not one to talk about other people’s affairs. “People’s” affairs.

“I’m not after something like revenge. It’s mere extermination. I’ll be properly curing you; you monsters which will not even follow the simple rules of this mere game.”

Rules? … Ah, I see.

This man, he is not astonished, he is truly angry.

Human emotions are difficult to understand.

“Wait just a bit longer, Guillotine Cutter. After that, in accordance with this game’s rules, I shall return my servant to humanity. In doing so, two demons will cease to exist at once; one shall die and one shall become human. Surely that will please thee? Will that not accomplish thine important mission? See reason and withdraw.”

This vampire hunter should have entered into that sort of agreement with the specialist. Otherwise, this would-be man of God Guillotine Cutter has no reason to acknowledge defeat. He will not withdraw from the battlefield.

“I won’t patiently wait, because nothing like that will be happening. You won’t be returning that child to humanity like that, such a thing isn’t possible.”

“Huh?”

I was reflexively annoyed with that scolding tone, but, no, what was it he just said? I don’t really understand, although I get the feeling I’ve just been insulted. Though, on the other hand, perhaps I’ve been praised? I had those sorts of suspicions.

Surely—exchanges between a demon and a human.

If he’s saying that he has the impression it was the exchanges between a demon and a demon…

“Art thou saying that I cannot be killed by him? Dost thou believe that, as my servant’s master, I do not possess that level of ability?”

“No. You could surely be killed by anyone—by Dramaturgy-san, by Episode-san, and by me as well. After all, you are someone who wishes to die, ohime-sama.”

“…………”

“I am, that is to say that God is, saying[^4] that that child cannot kill you. How is it that you say that this child who could not even kill me will be able to kill you?”

That—was certainly a problem.

To kill the master who drank his blood—the sole method for a demon to regain his humanity.

Betrayal, rebellion, revolution, insurrection.

Regardless of what is said, what could be done to enable that foolish servant to do such a thing?

Is he capable of dominicide?

Because next time, I will be telling the person who saved me when I was near death to kill me.

I tried to buy time in order to think up some way to ask during our last conversation, but if this is only an aggravation to the vampire hunters then this has become an extremely complicated situation.

“Leave.”

At any rate, I told Guillotine Cutter to leave. It was rather generous of me.

“As thou hast surmised, I am in a good mood at the moment. Just this once—no, for just this moment, I shall overlook this. Thou hast shown the strength to snatch away mine arms when I had lost my heart, and so I shall do so in respect of thy skills[^5]—I do not care to do it for the sake of the world. Nor do I do it for the sake of humans or out of respect for God. Allow the Oddity Killer to continue on like this. Leave this vampire who would destroy herself to her fate.”

“Destroy yourself? What you describe is not the same as suicide. If you intend to die, please do so alone. Do not bring that child into this.”

The man who tried childishly winning the game without choosing a strategy puts it well. 

How sly.

That way of doing things, so that “no one gets hurt”, is a fine talent for a pro. Even a child could understand that logic.

“Somehow or other, the moment has passed. Dost thou wish to die alone?”

“There’s a good way to go about this.”

Ignoring my kind advice, Guillotine Cutter once again drew near.

Though it is a game, having lost to my servant, it is only natural that he should have taken not only mental damage, but physical as well. How resolute.

Knowing no fear—knowing no limits.

That he is the way that he is, I do not like it at all; quite to the contrary—I despise it.

For I who refused to become a god, it is the complete opposite.

A good way?

“It would be best for me to be killed while seeking revenge against you. If that happens, the child will kill you and auspiciously become a human once again. If you do this, I can eliminate two vampires—it’s a plan that will make everyone happy.”

“Huh? Why would my servant kill me if I kill thee?”

What reason could my servant have to get revenge for his hated enemy?

Hast thou already forgotten what thou hast done to him?

“I won’t choose the method. As far as I’m concerned, even my life is just another means. My life is the easiest tool to use; it is a blade with which to pierce a demon.”

“Is that so? To the very end, thou art a man that I do not understand.”

“You don’t need to understand because that child surely will.”

“I understand thee less and less. Thou art a man I do not understand, a man I cannot understand. But, hmm, competing for all these years with a man I doubly cannot understand has been—”

I nearly said fun. That was too close.

I withdrew the demon sword “Kokorowatari” from within my body. It is a sword that can kill only demons, but he is practically like an oddity himself. 

We shall test the blade that pierces demons against the sword which kills them, literally.

“Now, I shall go, Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade. The iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire—the Oddity Killer. Allow me to show my earnestness. Don’t hold anything back!”

“Let us make it a feast, Guillotine Cutter! Vampire hunter! Rejoice, for I too shall show thee my earnestness as thou hast gone so far to claim thy prize! I shall fly in the sky. I shall sink within shadows. I shall become mist. I shall make myself disappear and I shall alter my form. I shall use my insight. I shall materialize that which I need—eat a full course! I shall hold none of this immortal body back!”

“Bon appétit!”

“Bon appétit!”

…… I do not intend to relate what happened afterwards.

I was victorious and he did not yield.

I was cut and he was broken.

I ate and he was not able to.

Until the very end, Guillotine Cutter was a man who I did not understand, and he fought back until the moment he died—as a human.

[^1]: She says 何をしに来た (nani wo shi ni kita) followed by 何を死にに来た (nani wo shini ni kita), it’s a pun in Japanese but doesn’t really translate as one.

[^2]: She says 何をしに来た (nani wo shi ni kita) followed by 何を死にに来た (nani wo shini ni kita), it’s a pun in Japanese but doesn’t really translate as one.

[^3]: In order, he used あなた (anata, “you”), お前 (omae, “you”), きみ (kimi, “you”) and 貴様 (kisama, “you”).

[^4]: He uses the verb 宣う (notamau, “saying”), which is more like “saying with hints of sarcasm or smugness”.

[^5]: She uses 手腕 (shuwan) here for her arms and for his skills; it means “ability” or “power”, but she’s also using it as a pun for Guillotine Cutter having stolen her abilities with her arms. The two kanji that make 手腕 are 手 (te, “hand”) and 腕 (ude, “arm”) respectively – you stole my power (arms) so I will respect yours.
