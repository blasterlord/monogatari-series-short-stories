I feel that this is a situation which for those who have come here through the anime is quite obvious, while those who have come here only through the figure will feel that nothing makes sense. It was soon after my weird coexistence with the violent specialist, Kagenui Yozuru’s shikigami, Ononoki Yotsugi had begun; Senjougahara Hitagi came to visit the Araragi residence.

As to why she came, more than saying that it was to see how my preparations for my university entrance exams were going, it would be more accurate to say that she came to ask “Araragi-kun, you are not slacking off on your studies, are you?”

But, actually, she did not ask me that question. Because she was struck speechless on seeing the plush doll that was in my room.

For someone like Senjougahara who is quite used to using sharp words, a situation where she couldn’t put two words together has to be quite something. Still, she is not someone who would become speechless at something on the level of seeing a plush doll in the room of a male high school student.

The reason Senjougahara became speechless was that the plush was actually Ononoki Yotsugi.

“Of course, irrespective of what a plush’s true form is, if I had come across a life-sized doll of a girl in my boyfriend’s room, I would be speechless too…”

I want to believe that when she looked back for a second, she was not thinking that she should go back.

“What is this? What is this about? As your girlfriend, I want an explanation.”

“Ahhhh well, so many things happened… And even if I try to explain it, it will be too difficult and inconvenient…”

More than an inconvenience, it will be a spoiler.

Though I did swear that I wouldn’t keep secrets about the supernatural from Senjougahara, it’s not like I wanted to keep it a secret. It was just that it would be very difficult to explain it.

In the end, how do I logically explain the fact that a former opponent of mine with whom I fought to the death is now in my house as a plush doll?

“…… Well, it doesn’t matter as long as it doesn’t hinder Araragi-kun’s exam preparations. Still… Hasn’t your house become like a haunted house?”

“A haunted house…?”

That’s quite a harsh way of saying it.

Still, when I’m myself something of an oddity, it is quite possible that the place I live in is like a haunted house, I suppose. As Ononoki was behaving perfectly like a doll in front of people, there was no reaction even when she was poked, had her hair stroked or kissed on the cheek by Senjougahara.

Actually, she really is a doll—

“You! What are you doing? It’s my plush. Isn’t it weird for you to be kissing it on the cheek?”

“It is making me curious. Also you may have forgotten, Araragi-kun, but I love cute girls.”

“Isn’t that Kanbaru’s setting…?”

Now the situation of the Valhalla Combination where supposedly Kanbaru included Senjougahara by herself has become quite suspicious.

“Can I take this home with me?”

“No. Obviously you cannot take it home with you.”

“Why not?”

“Why is that in katakana now?”

“I can’t take it, no matter what?”

“Like I said, what is the use of saying it in katakana?”[^1]

Ononoki-chan did not even react to our conversation.

The way she was pretending to be an inanimate thing was so good, that even I, who was watching her move and talk till the moment Senjougahara rang the intercom, almost believed that she was a real doll—yeah, of course Ononoki-chan is a real doll and is really not alive.

Still, when I think about the fact that she is actually made from a human dead body, I cannot believe how horrifying a thing is there in my room.

And Senjougahara, who is now stroking such a doll, is also like a witch.

“Hmm, so I can’t take her home no matter what, right? I did expect Araragi-kun’s ‘no’, though”

I thought “Don’t think of it as ‘Araragi-kun’s ‘no’; instead think of it as being for Araragi-kun’s sake.”

“So, how do you have to think of me for the topic to become whether you can take Ononoki-chan home?”

“Well, if you are being stared at by such a cute plush, while you are studying for your entrance exams, won’t it be distracting? Wouldn’t it become difficult to concentrate?”

“Difficult to…?

What are you? My wife?

Still, it was a sharp observation.

Strictly speaking, Ononoki-chan belongs to my younger sister, Tsukihi. So it’s not like she’ll always be in my room. Still, it’s not a very good feeling to study with someone watching you and without being distracted by the cuteness.

“Fufu, it is alright, Araragi-kun. I thought something like this might happen. So there is something that I brought for such a situation.”

“If you say that you expected something like this to happen, it’s not in-line with how you were speechless in the beginning, is it?”

“My brilliant idea to divide Araragi-kun’s light and dark parts… Do you want to hear it?”

“I don’t want to hear it, but…”

It cannot be avoided.

“In order to cancel out the effect of a cute figure, all you have to do is use a cuter figure. JAAANNNNN!!!”

With that sound effect, Senjougahara pulled “that” out of her bag.

“A product of Good Smile Company, ‘Nendoroid Senjougahara Hitagi’. If you have this on your desk, no matter what distractions are around you, you will not get any thoughts of slacking off.”

Look at her, doing such things as if she were a really honest type of girl…!

Brilliant idea or not, it just feels like the number of eyes looking at me has just doubled. In the end, I was the one who became speechless.

“The Hitagi Figure to watch over your home from morning till night. Note: the hair will not grow.”

“Though it can be changed with another style.”

“In order to keep you company during your exam time, how about two per household?”

“Stop trying to make them buy one more.”

[^1]: The “not” and “no matter what” are in katakana, which is used for emphasis.
