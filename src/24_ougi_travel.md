I’m sure you’ve read Jules Verne’s Around the World in Eighty Days, haven’t you? Although today’s society, filled with all sorts of fun and recreation to be found outside of books, has slowly but surely drifted away from literature, there are still certain classics that everyone should read. I think that Around the World in Eighty Days is inarguably one of those classics. Don’t you agree, Hanekawa-senpai?

“I do… But I find it hard to believe that you honestly think that, Ougi-chan,” Hanekawa-senpai answers, looking irritated by my friendly inquiry.

Hanekawa-senpai is friendly towards everyone and always has a smile on her face, yet somehow she never seems to show me that angelic smile of hers. It’s quite disheartening. *Sob*.

“What do you mean, ‘*sob*’…? You’re the one who’s always smiling.”

“Oh, that’s true.”

I wouldn’t call it angelic, though.

Still, I’m often told that I have a lovely smile.

“I know that you have plans to travel the world after graduating… So how about it? At what age did you finish reading Around the World in Eighty Days? I’m certain that Hanekawa-senpai, the person Araragi-senpai admires so much, has already read such a prestigious work. If you tell me that you haven’t read it, I’ll be thoroughly dejected. Even more dejected than the time I bought a book based on its title, only to find that the title was actually the editor’s idea.”

Of course, that’s often the case with books.

At any rate, the truth is that there’s an infinite number of classics out there, enough that a person couldn’t hope to read all of them within their own lifetime. If Hanekawa-senpai hadn’t read Jules Verne’s novel yet, it wouldn’t be particularly surprising.

“I’ve read it. I think I finished it when I was in second grade.”

But, well. You know how this person is.

As a hedge between keeps antipathy green, out of courtesy, I offered, “You know everything, Hanekawa-senpai.” But as expected, she didn’t respond with her usual catchphrase. It would seem she truly isn’t fond of me. Well, I suppose my goal here isn’t to endear myself to Hanekawa-senpai, so—with a heavy heart—I must simply press on with the conversation.

“What were your impressions? Either at the time, or looking back on it now.”

“My impressions…? It was an enjoyable read, I suppose,” Hanekawa-senpai answers, looking wary.

Oh dear, you don’t have to be so guarded. Right now, I’m just trying to have a light-hearted book discussion. It’s not like I’m planning to lure you into some sort of trap.

“Hmm, how to put it? I remember the fact that he went through Japan on his trip around the world made me really happy. Now I’m steering the conversation away from Around the World in Eighty Days specifically, but whenever Japan is mentioned in an old foreign classic, it’s a bit of a shock. I know it should be obvious, but it really drives home that Japan was actually around hundreds and thousands of years ago.”

“Oh?”

That’s a rather peculiar view. It doesn’t appear to be as simple as feeling happy to stumble across a familiar name in a foreign land… As an avid consumer of all sorts of stories, I’d like to delve a little further into this.

“Do you mean to say that it’s objective proof of Japan’s existence, like an endorsement from a guarantor? And thus, upon catching a glimpse of the foreign perspective of Japan through printed media, you felt a sense of relief…”

“No, no, I was only in second grade, so of course I didn’t have such complex thoughts about it… It’s closer to the feeling of reading a story you thought was fiction, only to suddenly find out that it’s actually non-fiction, or that it was based on real events or people. … Though, I suppose someone whose whole existence feels like it belongs in fiction wouldn’t really understand that.”

“Oh my, that was harsh… Well, I’m a rather shallow reader, so I simply enjoyed the heart-pounding romanticism of a handsome British man traveling the world, while elegantly evading all the perils that face him.”

“… Can you even comprehend the concept of romanticism?”

“Come now, Hanekawa-senpai. To say that my true identity is romanticism itself would be an absolute exaggeration.”

“So it would be an exaggeration…”

“But considering how you’re planning to go location scouting soon, I suppose that traveling the world is no longer in the realm of romanticism, but a simple reality for you. Before long, I’m sure fictional stories won’t be enough to satisfy you… You could say that it’s Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets in practice.”[^2]

“Hmm… I’m not sure about that.”

“? What is it? You appear to have objections. Do you mean to disregard the opinion of someone whose uncle is a traveler—or rather, a wanderer—as not worth listening to?”

“Do you really have to put it like that…?” Hanekawa-senpai mutters, shrugging her shoulders in frustration. “Your uncle travels all over the country as part of his work… But I hardly think that means he threw away his books. In fact, doesn’t he travel around to collect stories?”

I see, that’s sensible logic. It’s not like Oshino Meme is wandering from place to place in order to write up a novel… But it’s also true that novels aren’t the only form a story can take.

“The protagonist of Around the World in Eighty Days, Fogg, started out on his journey because of a bet he made with his friends. So, when you think about it, just the idea that ‘a person can travel around the world’ can become the basis for a full novel. In that sense, traveling could be considered a way of looking for stories, as well as a way of creating them.”

“Hmm. That’s something I understand quite well, as someone who’s lived a long life as a transfer student. It’s true that no matter how many times you transfer from school to school, you never quite get used to it—just like a story that always has a continuation.”

“I wonder about that,” Hanekawa-senpai responds, completely distrustful of my words.

Hehehe, I suppose we really can’t get along with each other. Don’t worry, I’ll happily see you off on your trip. Unlike the detective Fix, I don’t intend to stand in the way of your journey—your story.[^3] In fact, I’d prefer that you start out on it as soon as possible.

“By the way, if we consider that it was possible to travel the world in eighty days back in 1873, when Around the World in Eighty Days was first published, how many days do you think it would take now? If you take an airplane, I believe it’s possible to do it in a mere matter of days… But I suppose that would be a bit lacking in drama.”

“Who knows? But no matter how many days it takes, no matter how short a trip it is, I’ll always bring a couple of books with me. The books you read on a trip are the most exciting,” Hanekawa-senpai says.

“Don’t throw away your books, and go on a journey”—is that your intention?

Always learning, but never losing your sense of fun, hm?

I really hate that about you.

With a smile on my face, I say:

“You’re such a fool.”

Here, 闇 (yami, “darkness”) is replaced with 私 (watashi, “me”). The overall meaning is that because the future is uncertain, you should just say “no” or do nothing.
