The following is a true story from six hundred years ago. However, I would prefer you think of it as fiction. Why? It is too old a story to have much measure of authenticity, and it has neither lessons nor morals—I am sure such a story would be better taken as a lie.



Around six hundred years ago, in a country whose name has been lost to time, there was a very beautiful girl. The only daughter of an affluent noble, her portrait adorned the homes of every family in the nation—there were none who did not know of her beauty.

Her smooth blond hair, her large eyes, her small head, her bright red lips, her delicate neck, her gossamer skin, her fingers like slender icefish, and her slender, long legs, flowing down from her thin, high waist.

Men and women, young and old, regardless of status were all mesmerized. Simply for her beauty, she was honored with a title by His Majesty the Emperor; the whole nation called her “Princess Beauty”, and loved her. The rumors spread, and the citizens formed a great line before her castle, trying to catch a glimpse of her. And so, the rare charm of Princess Beauty far exceeding their expectations, they brought her gifts. Day after day, the mountain of presents before the castle grew larger.

The musician said, “I have made Your Highness’ beauty into a song. Please accept it,” and played his violin.

The poet said, “I have made Your Highness’ beauty into a poem. Please accept it,” and his voice resounded in recitation.

The artist said, “I have made Your Highness’ beauty into a sculpture. Please accept it,” and carved a hundred statues.

But none of their gifts made the princess smile. In deep melancholy she gazed at the mountain of presents, and yet, the way that sorrow tinged her face was so beautiful that nobody noticed she was not smiling.

“Nobody will look at me,” the princess lamented, alone in her room. “They extol me as beautiful, beautiful, but they say nothing more. They know nothing of what kind of person I am. They do not know how I am on the inside.”

That was Princess Beauty’s distress.

Everyone, certainly, was charmed by her beauty. They praised her. Above all else, they looked at her. However, they simply looked at her outward appearance, and no matter what she did or what she said, they paid no attention to her behavior or her actions.

Nobody knew how she was on the inside; nor did they try to learn.

Whatever she did, whatever she said, they thought of nothing but the phrase “Princess Beauty”. Whether she succeeded or failed, whether she did right or wrong, their evaluation was always the same. Whatever she did was beautiful. Beautiful asleep and beautiful awake. “Princess Beauty” was the perfect name for her.

Is such beauty as that not rather devilish in nature?

“It hardly seems to matter whether or not I have a will of my own. But I am not a slave to my appearance. This beauty with which I so happened to be born has proved nothing but a nuisance. I want them to see how I am on the inside, not just on the outside.”

To not rely on her own beauty.

An old witch who had lived in the country since ancient times was moved by her magnificent strength of will.

She stole into the castle at night, originally simply curious about the rumors she had heard; however, she decided to grant the princess’ wish.

“Princess Beauty. I will render your beauty transparent, such that nobody will be able to see it. Instead, I will make it so everyone around you can see your inner heart. From now on, it will be a matter of how you are on the inside.”

The old witch chanted a spell and waved her wand, the princess’ gossamer skin became truly transparent.

“Thank you. Thank you.”

“Princess Beauty” was grateful from the bottom of her heart.

A heart now in plain sight of all.



Her exterior beauty cleared away, the princess’ exposed heart was unparalleled in its beauty. Her true nature, which until then was concealed by her resplendent appearance, had been made visible by the old witch—even while she remained inside the castle, its radiance spread through all the corners of the nation.

Ashamed of never being able to see the utter beauty of his daughter’s heart, the moment after saying his morning greetings, the princess’ father jumped off the balcony to punish himself. Proud of giving birth to a daughter of such magnificent disposition, as if in so doing she had completed the role for which she had been born into the world, the princess’ mother peacefully passed away after eating breakfast.

The musician, believing Princess Beauty’s kindness to be altogether inexpressible through song, instead offered her his most precious belonging, more precious than his life—cutting off the hands he used to play his instruments, he offered them to the princess as a suitable gift. The poet, believing Princess Beauty’s wisdom to be altogether inexpressible through poetry, instead offered her his most precious belonging, more precious than his life—tearing out the tongue he used to recite his poems, he offered it to the princess as a suitable gift. The artist, believing Princess Beauty’s bravery to be altogether inexpressible through sculpture, instead offered her his most precious belonging, more precious than his life—gouging out the eyes he used to inspect his materials, he offered them to the princess as a suitable gift.

All the nation’s citizens burned the portraits of the princess which, until then, they had treasured. They wondered why they had been so dedicated to such a pointless decoration. More importantly, they thought, look at the purity of “Princess Beauty”. Look at her righteousness. Who could have imagined such a meritorious heart existed in the world? Is that not true beauty?

But not everyone owned things more precious than their lives. So, reluctantly, begrudgingly, thinking that such trifles could never be suitable for the princess, they offered her their lives. They offered up their own lives, their relatives’ lives, their children’s lives, their grandchildren’s lives. The mountain of gifts before the castle became a mountain of corpses, and it did not take much time for it to grow taller than the castle walls.

“Ah! Such tragedy! To think it would come to this!”

Despairing at the mountain of bodies and river of blood that had been sacrificed for her sake, the princess went to the old witch to try to lift the magic spell. But it was too late: the old witch was the very first to behold the princess’ inner beauty, and had long since offered up what was more precious to her than her life—the head in which she had cultivated many long years’ worth of knowledge. The princess broke down crying before the old witch’s severed head.

That pitiable form, that beautiful heart which sheds tears for others, bewitched the nation more and more. They scrambled and competed to offer the princess their lives, or what was more precious than their lives. To console the princess, they threw their lives away one after another, smiling all the while. They seemed so very happy to be able to behold her beautiful heart without being deceived by her appearance, and to die for her sake.

The ill repute of the growing mountain of corpses—or rather, the castle of corpses—naturally became well-known in the imperial capital and neighboring countries; however, whenever the latest armies would come rushing in, they would succumb to Princess Beauty’s power. Their preconceptions and prejudices swept away, their hearts washed clean, happily and of their own desire, they became part of the mountain of corpses.

“Enough. Everyone is dying. Everyone is dying for me. I cannot save any of them. The more I do, the more I speak, people die. I wish only to die.”

But she was unable to die. The strength of her heart would not permit it. She could not even go mad.

“In that case, go on a journey.”

The old witch’s severed head spoke. The tears the princess had spilled caused a miracle. For just one moment, the old woman had come back to life.

“Someday, you may be able to help those who die the sake of your accursed beauty. Until then, distance yourself from people. Live alone, and do not grow close with anyone. You mustn’t stay in one place for too long. If you do, people will soon come to sacrifice their lives to you.”

With that, the old woman breathed her last once again.



Thus, “Princess Beauty” departed the castle that had been stained bright red with the color of blood and the great mountain of corpses beside it, and set off on an unending journey. In order to prevent any more people from dying, she followed the old witch’s curse-like advice. It was a lonesome flight, one in which nobody could accompany her. It was some time after this that she became a vampire, but these were the circumstances in which the princess—Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade’s bloodstained, vampiric legend began.

And six hundred years later, for the first time, she was able to save one tiny life that had been sacrificed to her pure heart.
