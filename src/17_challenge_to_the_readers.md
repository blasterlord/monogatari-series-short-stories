Hai hai, hello to all readers of this Shonen Magazine supplement. Oshino Ougi here. “Arslan Senki” is interesting, isn’t it! I enjoyed reading both the first and the second episode very much. I really like feeling excited when I read manga. It was so much fun, I thought about reading the original work on occasion. The feeling that reading is chained like this is really fun. I could keep reading books forever. It’s a perpetual reading mechanism. Anyway, what kind of developments is awaiting in the third episode published this month? I want to get out of the classroom soon and return to reading.

So, this is the “challenge to the readers”. Please stop reading the novel here, and deduce the truth of the case that Araragi-senpai encountered in first year. As I declared in the work, everything needed to identify the true culprit has been given. To say it in the style of old game books: “Please, solve the mystery to free us of this locked room!”. Well, even if I say it this way, most people don’t know about old game books. Actually, I don’t know either. I don’t know anything.

By the way, the one who invented this “challenge to the readers” is a great mystery writer called Ellery Queen. If you put this sentence before the solution, the reader is forced to narrow down the answer to one, and after reading, he goes “Ah, I knew the criminal from the beginning”. Mystery writers seem to be able to masterfully avoid those who boast about finding a certain part of the novel suspicious. Well, when I read a mystery novel I basically find everyone suspicious, so when someone isn’t, it’s definitely the criminal. In the end it’s just guessing, isn’t it. When I heard that story, I thought that the experts who leave their name in history were too smart.

Experts aside, as far as realistic things are concerned, it’s impossible to eliminate the possibility of a coincidence, or an outsider. Also, since this case happened in a world with oddities, I can’t rule out that it’s “the act of a ghost” that transcends the laws of physics, but well, saying it in mathematical terms, that’s probability theory. Let’s go with what is possible, or has the highest probability—when you can’t remove all the options that are logically impossible, the truth is the one that’s logically most likely. Please identify who created the incomprehensible situation faced by class 1-3, whether it’s someone who attended the study group organized by Oikura-senpai, or someone who didn’t attend the study group with a different approach.

For the sake of clarity, I inserted a list of characters on the next page, with a simplified profile attached. This is common in foreign mystery novels—it’s not in order of appearance but in alphabetical order, but well, please consider that the culprit is someone in this list. You could say it’s a multiple-choice question. Although I don’t know if a question with so many options can be considered a multiple-choice question, if you can guess, you can feel something unnatural even from this table alone.

I must claim here that I, Oshino Ougi, am not the culprit (of course, it’s alright not to suspect Kanbaru-senpai as well). Please keep in mind the possibility of the narrator Araragi-senpai or the poor Oikura-senpai being the perpetrator. If Araragi-senpai was the culprit, I would throw my own character away and burst into laughter. That’s hilarious—wait, is this Episode-san’s character?

One hint.

As I pointed out, Araragi-senpai hides some information when retelling the story of his past. However, he is not lying. In front of me, even if you have secrets, you can’t lie—basically. This time, it’s within the basics.

By the way, this story is one of the arcs included in “Owarimonogatari”, scheduled to be released in October, but this “challenge to the readers” will not be included in that case. This is Ougi-chan service limited to this Shonen Magazine supplement. The character table will also be cut, so everyone, you were lucky!

The time limit is, let’s see, only five minutes—is what I’d like to say, but I feel sorry for taking five minutes of everyone’s precious time, so let’s say two minutes. It’s two minutes from 5:58 where the clock’s hands stopped, until the school bell rings. If you can’t answer within two minutes, please pick someone from the suspect list on the next page, depending on your intuition (needless to say, you don’t have to think about any accomplice). Of course, you can follow your intuition and get the right answer. Even mathematics, like other subjects, is an academic field that can’t be established without intuition. But please don’t just decide by majority vote. For the sake of this foolish Araragi-senpai.

Well then, I wish you scrutiny and good luck.
