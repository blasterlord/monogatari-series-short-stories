In the opening of Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot, are his famous Three Laws of Robotics. The book itself is a collection of short stories, but all of them involve the relationship between humans and robots who are ensnared by the Laws. The story that I, Oshino Shinobu, was most excited about was the sixth story, Little Lost Robot. The sorrow of a robot enslaved to those inferior to it, and the determination to stand up to the humans by taking advantage of the small loopholes in the rules that govern its life was quite thrilling, even to me as a vampire having lived five hundred years.

“Hmm… Now that you mention it, I remember that you were a big science fiction fan, Shinobu-oneechan. I guess a monster that just lives for a long time would be quite fascinated with future civilizations.”

The Doll Girl, shikigami of that violent exorcist, Ononoki Yotsugi, nodded without a hint of expression or emotion.

“Unfortunately, the only science fiction I’ve read is Diaspora.”

“Don’t lie.”

Are you trying to brag?

Seeing as this little girl is both a doll and a shikigami, she is essentially a robot, but possibly due to the violent exorcist’s principles, she doesn’t seem to have the Three Laws installed.

“The Three Laws? You mean cyan, magenta and yellow?”[^2]

“Those are the three primary colors. Also I don’t remember ever allowing you to call me by that ridiculous name ‘Shinobu-oneechan’.”

“But you still get mad at me when I call you Shinobu-oneechan.”

“Are you asking me not to?”

“Well, the only science fiction I’ve read is Diaspora.”

It seems she’s still quite proud of that.

Her stubbornness is quite the sight however.

“I find myself quite interested in the theme of humans being used as tools for the convenience of civilization. Don’t you think humans, not in science fiction or robots, actual humans, fundamentally have a tendency towards self-destruction along with the advancement of civilization? Don’t you think that instead of advancing, they’re degenerating? Instead of getting more refined, they’re simply being weeded out? I always think ‘All of the products of scientific advancement we have are supposed to make our lives easier, but we can never really rein them in.’ ”

“Well, when you lump all humans together, it seems like the people who ‘create’ those tools of convenience for society and those who ‘use’ them are often different people.”

In fact, with all of the diverse “products of scientific advancement” there are, you can’t just lump them up all together. That said, I do understand what the Doll Girl was trying to say to some extent. I did find the world “self-destruction” a bit too strong.

“You thought the word was a bit too strong? Sorry about that. I wasn’t trying to take a dig at you, Shinobu-oneechan, what with your familiar rebelling against you and leaving you a pitiful shadow of your former self.”

“What an earsore.”

I don’t want to hear that from some shikigami no one can even control. But I wonder, if a tool used by our civilization, like a car, or a cellphone, or a game console, or a weapon, anything really, were conscious, would it want to be used by humans?”

Assuming that being controlled by a lesser being would be a disgrace to it and assuming that accepting this control itself would be a fundamentally painful experience, would being controlled by a perfect being, one that would allow it to use its functions to its fullest capability, one that could open up its vast bank of knowledge, would it still be reluctant to be controlled by such a being?

“That’s a meaningless pretense assumption. In the real world, if we were to give machines consciousness we’d be talking about fantasy, not science fiction, Shinobu-oneechan.”

“Stop being such an earsore again.”

That’s another thing I don’t want a tsukumogami like you telling me.

Actually, should you really be saying that?

“In the first place,” the Doll Girl continued expressionlessly and emotionlessly, paying no heed to my critical glare. Is that all there is to this girl?

“That ‘perfect being’ would be part of fantasy anyway. There’s no way it could really exist. People’s desire for it to exist has actually left human society worse off to a greater or lesser extent.”

“Hmm…”

Says the person who’s never even read the books.

“Why bother using a big and fancy-sounding phrase like ‘to a greater or lesser extent’, couldn’t you just say ‘more or less’ ” was what I was about to say, but I was interested enough to generously remain silent.

“That sounds rather interesting. Continue.”

“There’s not much for me to ‘continue’ on to. I was just saying what I thought of off the top of my head. But if you really want me to, I would say that that ‘perfect being’ would probably be the controlled rather than the controller, or the used rather than the user. Of course, if you look at it from the controller’s point of view, there’d be no point in controlling a useless being.”

“Ka ka, a useless master with a capable slave. I suppose the both of us know quite well that it’s not always the strong that control the weak.”

“Right. ‘Survival of the fittest’ is easy to understand, but the relationship between the strong and weak isn’t always that simple. You could say that situations like ‘David and Goliath’ aren’t uncommon in our society.”

The trick to clawing your way to the top of society is to know how to throw those above you down below you. That’s the way it is and that’s how it’s always been—the Doll Girl said with an all-knowing tone.

Are you some vassal planning to overthrow their lord?

And “clawing your way to the top” was quite a strong choice of words again.

The “Humanity Association” that appears in I, Robot was acting in anticipation of a robot rebellion I remember, but I suppose I shouldn’t bring that up with the Doll Girl never having read it before. She’s not just being controlled by the violent exorcist, and she doesn’t seem to be conscious of the fact that she’s stuck below the humans… Actually, does she even have a consciousness in the first place?

Although, I find it quite interesting that even without a consciousness, she seems to be able to think of things. I get the feeling this has quite a few implications.

“Hmm, I feel like I’m starting to lose track of this conversation that I was on top of at the beginning.”

“I suppose you know what it’s like now to have been at the top in the beginning only to fall to the very bottom.”

“Who said I’m at the very bottom now.”

“Now that I think about it, being a controller doesn’t seem like a stroll in the park anymore, it seems more troublesome than I thought to rule over those greater than oneself. I almost want to throw it all away and just fall to the bottom. That’s what you did isn’t it?

“…”

“Let’s go back to our original topic, maybe losing grasp of the reins on something you created by yourself in the beginning is just part of nature. Humans developed their civilization in order to do the things that they couldn’t do themselves. It was just too much for them all along.”

“Even so, we can’t just go back to living in caves. All we can do is fall into ruin along with civilization.”

“I hope that civilization is all that’s left.”

She said without a hint of a smile on her face, some sort of joke that no one would find funny. She probably would have added “I said with a posed look” a while ago. Although, she was right, in the real world without the Three Laws, not like the future Asimov envisioned in I, Robot, humanity and science may not be able to coexist forever.

I started imagining.

I imagined a world where humans had all disappeared, where everyone had long disappeared, a world fallen into an annihilation brought on by itself. A world that would fall into ruin even without me. And indeed, it seemed like a place that would be dominated by the complex and bizarre tools of civilization rather than wicked spirits and monsters. And so I would simply stare in horror at such a world and say

“… Not bad.”[^3]

[^1]: It says 往年の話をすれば鬼が泣く (ounen no hanashi o sureba oni ga naku), which is a play on the expression 来年のことを言えば鬼が笑う (rainen no koto o ieba oni ga warau, “the devil laughs at talk of the future”) meaning you can’t rely on the future.

[^2]: Yotsugi mistakes The Three Laws (三原則, sangensoku) for The Three Primary colors (三原色, sangenshoku).

[^3]: One of Shinobu’s catchphrases, ぱないの (panaino), is a contraction of 半端じゃないの (hanpa ja nai no, literally “it’s not half-bad”). According to Araragi’s suspicions, at some point she lost sight of the original meaning and started using it as a greeting.
