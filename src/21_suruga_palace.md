Read The Red House Mystery by A. A. Milne, Kanbaru Suruga. When it comes to Milne, he is, without it needing to be said, most famous for being the children’s author who wrote Winnie the Pooh, but apparently the only full-length mystery he ever wrote was this book, The Red House Mystery. So that’s why I read it. What? The guy who wrote Winnie the Pooh wrote a mystery novel? I want to read it! I want to read it!—that was pretty much my train of thought. There are probably people who would say that I’m not a real appreciator of literature if they saw me like that, but I don’t particularly like having my eating habits, let alone my reading habits criticized by other people.

“I’m sure they’re right though, I’m pretty indiscriminate in my choice of books. Kanbaru, what mood you configure your bookshelves to is what one may call your prerogative, but a selection from such an eccentric direction is not something I can very well approve of. The Red House Mystery?”

“No, I haven’t read it yet.”—said Senjougahara-senpai as she appeared to trace back her memories. She is a person who can look like a god no matter what pose she takes—I’m jealous.

“But, well, I think I just might have heard the plot somewhere. Ah, oh no! If I recall any more, I might remember the main plot twist.”

It seems that somewhere along the way she had heard the plot of the story up to a crucial point. I suppose that’s just the fate of old classics. Let’s say it’s hard to avoid spoilers in this day and age.

“On the other hand, I have no idea about the plot of Winnie the Pooh. Let me see… Was it something like Pooh is actually a doll?”

“That was the premise from the beginning, Senjougahara-senpai.”

“Oh, is that so.”

Her range of expressions had become much wider recently and now there were some faces she would only show me, but she would still act all displeased when someone pointed out her mistakes. That was one thing that hadn’t changed about Senjougahara-senpai since middle school.

“I wonder which one came first?”

“Hmm?”

“I wonder whether Milne wrote The Red House Mystery or Winnie the Pooh first.”

“I think Winnie the Pooh came after.”

“Hmm. Somehow I always had the impression that The Red House Mystery came first… I don’t mean he didn’t make it big writing mystery novels so he switched over to children’s books or something.”

“Hmm. I don’t know much about Milne, but apparently he was the type of author who didn’t like writing the things that people wanted.”

I suppose that wording would be my usual not quite correct spin on it, but even without considering my natural tendency to be somewhat impolite, the foreword of The Red House Mystery certainly gave off that impression.

“In the beginning he made a name for himself as a humor playwright, but when people started wanting him to write those sorts of works, he started writing murder mystery novels, and when those started becoming popular, in other words when people started wanting him to write them, for some reason he started writing Winnie the Pooh.”

“You could say he was the type of author who didn’t want to be stuck with a specific label, but I can sympathize with the feeling as a human of not wanting to do something because someone else wants you to.”

A bit of Senjougahara’s character from before her rebirth was coming back, and you could just take that as a cute sort of humanness, hearing a high school girl saying that. But there would be quite a few troubled people if a popular author were to say that (their editor, or in Milne’s case his agent).

“But out of all the people in the writing industry, there has to be a certain number of them who can’t work under someone else’s requests. You could say they’re artists exactly because of that.”

It’s quite a difficult position. If you let a genius run wild it wouldn’t produce a very entertaining piece of work, so in the end some amount of restrictions is needed, but in my personal opinion as an individual not gifted with artistic genius, trying to impose control as opposed to restrictions upon the inborn nature of an artist wouldn’t allow them to create anything you could call “entertainment” either. You’d just end up with something completely ridiculous. Milne wrote this in his foreword: “I could take pride in even a trite and bland phone book if I wrote it with passion, but I would find it against my conscience to write even a refined blank verse tragedy if I did so under someone else’s command.” I’m the type of person who enjoys obeying the commands of those I respect, so to be honest I don’t understand this sort of artistic sense very well. I would say fulfilling people’s expectations is the greatest joy, but if I were Milne, the famous Winnie the Pooh would never have been written… But considering the possibility that more masterpieces of mystery fiction might have followed The Red House Mystery, I would say that no matter how it turned out it would simply be a matter of taste.

“But in the end, don’t you think there’s a nice balance to it? The fight between the publishers and readers who want the authors to write works that they enjoy and the rebellious authors. Did you know, the thing that troubles authors the most is when people ask them to write however they like.”

“I can understand that… Sort of.”

Even outside of basketball, it isn’t quite as interesting without that bit of strategy when people tell you to just do whatever you want. That said, if an author just continued to write whatever the readers wanted, there’s no guarantee that the readers would always respond how the author wanted. Being told to just do whatever you want can be quite troubling, but that certainly doesn’t mean that doing whatever someone else wants will be easy.

“In the end the happiest outcome would be for the authors to write whatever they want and the readers to read whatever they want but… Wait. I wonder if this would just be approving of your wild style of choosing books.”

That would be quite troubling—Senjougahara-senpai said.

“Now that you mention it,” she said with a clap of her hands.

“I had a conversation like this with Araragi-kun a while ago. Something about how we read books. Oh that silly Araragi-kun,[^2] do you know what he said?”

I was a bit annoyed at the sight of my senior I respected so much speaking like some character out of a movie, but since I had gotten interested, I listened just like that.

“ ‘In this day and age, I would say just reading paper books itself is already pretty good, and I’m sure any author would be happy to see that too.’ Well that’s true.”

Indeed. Indeed, and realizing that being praised by Araragi-senpai wasn’t something that happened all the time, I was so happy I lost control of myself for a moment with all my emotions pouring in at once, and I said

“… That’s Araragi-senpai for you.”

[^1]: This expression is usually written 合縁奇縁 (aien kien). Here, the kanjis 縁 have been replaced with 猿 (“monkey”) which is usually pronounced さる (saru) but in this case has an indicated alternate reading of えん (en) to make the expression work.

[^2]: Senjougahara refers to Araragi in a very endearing but old-fashioned and almost melodramatic way here.
