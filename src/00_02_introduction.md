# Introduction

## So… what are these short stories?
As you may know, the Monogatari Series is a light novel series written by the talented author Nisio Isin starting from 2006. When it received an anime adaptation by Shaft in 2009, it quickly contributed to the series becoming immensely popular, and many kinds of merchandise, such as supplementary books, Blu-ray/DVD sets or figures, have been released ever since. With those are often included short story arcs written by Nisio Isin, in the same style as the light novels and usually named according to the same naming scheme ([first name] [word]), sometimes as a way to expand on certain plot points that were only alluded to in the novels and anime, but more generally just to give extra interactions and fun conversations between the characters as usual.

## Are all the stories there?
I sort of arbitrarily divide the stories into three main categories:

- The main short stories, the largest bulk of short arcs written in the same style as the novels. Until recently, it always followed the classic [first name] [word] naming scheme, but now it also includes a set of five stories that don’t follow this naming scheme but still adhere to a short story format and are visibly related to the main plot, as they directly tie into _Kizumonogatari_.

- The crossover stories, which for the time being comprise _Mazemonogatari_, a set of 15 longer stories (of which 12 have been released so far) where Araragi meets various characters from other series written by Nisio Isin, and _Tsubasa Lion_, a crossover with Umino Chika’s manga series March Comes in Like a Lion, featuring Kiriyama Rei as the narrator.

- Additional material, everything that doesn’t follow a normal short story format, but is written by or told from the perspective of a character.

This tome contains every main short story, except _Mayoi Welcome_ which I haven’t been able to find anywhere, and of course except the stories that have been published after this book’s release, or that haven’t been translated yet.

The crossover stories aren’t included here, both due to a lack of translations and because they’re long enough that they could fill an entire second book on their own.

Finally, while this book contains most of the additional material (interspersed through the main short stories), it omits the transcript of the _Bakemonogatari_ Drama CD, _Hyakumonogatari_, for similar concerns of length. 

## Are they canon?
Unless someone can prove me wrong, I firmly believe that all the main short stories are canon. Some of them are plot-related and referenced in the light novels. For example, the short story _Mayoi Room_ explains why Hachikuji forgot her backpack at Araragi’s house on August 20; in _Shinobu Time_, Araragi actually tells the reader to check out the _Bakemonogatari Anime Complete Guidebook_ for more information.

The crossover stories might be different, like taking place in a “what-if” alternate universe. The current lack of translations makes it impossible to say for sure at the moment, but I’ve read that some of these stories also reference the main plot and so would have a place in the timeline. For the time being, my judgment on their canonicity is reserved.
So my answer is that yes, the main short stories are canon; and maybe the crossover stories are too.

## I don’t want to read 40 stories, which ones are important?
None of them is truly crucial to understand the series, but some of them are indeed related to the plot in some way and are not just funny conversations between our beloved characters. If you must choose, here are the ones that you really should read:

- _Mayoi Room_: while not really important in itself, it does explain why Hachikuji was in Araragi’s room and forgot her backpack here shortly before the events of _Mayoi Jiangshi_.

- _Tsukihi Eternal_, _Karen Arm-Leg_, _Hitagi Neck_, _Shinobu House_: the four stories of the “Gahara Summit”, or what happened when Araragi introduced his girlfriend to his sisters after _Tsukihi Phoenix_.

- _Rouka God_: when Kaiki came to talk to Rouka about her activities, leading to the events in _Suruga Devil_.

- _Yotsugi Stress_: in _Tsubasa Tiger_, there is a timeskip after Black Hanekawa and Shinobu arrive at the cram school that just burned down. It’s then hinted in _Shinobu Mail_ that they met an oddity and fought against it. This story starts at the end of this fight.

- _Princess Beauty_: presented as a fairy tale, but it’s the true origin story of the child who later became Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.

- _As a Human_, _Something Wrong_, _And Then_, _Why_, _With Caution_: a set of _Kizumonogatari_-related stories, each told in the perspective of a different character.

- _Karen Brushing_, _Tsukihi Brushing_: amazingly, it’s even worse than the toothbrushing scene in _Nisemonogatari_. And by worse I mean better. So much better.

## What’s the reading order?
If you’re up to date with the anime, you should have enough context for most of the stories. Some of the plot-related stories need you to have read/watched until a certain arc to understand (for example, _Rouka God_ is a prequel to the events in _Suruga Devil_, and _Yotsugi Stress_ expands upon something that’s only mentioned in _Shinobu Mail_), but other than that, you should be fine. If you’re not sure, just catch up with the anime before getting to the short stories.

You can read them in any order you want since they’re almost all independent. Currently, the only exception is the set of four _Nisemonogatari Guidebook stories_ (_Tsukihi Eternal_, _Karen Arm-Leg_, _Hitagi Neck_, _Shinobu House_) organized in chronological order.


## What’s the chronological order?
As usual with Monogatari, the short stories are all over the timeline. Unfortunately, most of the stories don’t have enough indications to deduce the exact date, but some of them are known due to their relation with other plot elements. I have attempted to construct a full timeline of the series before, but it will be omitted in this book as it’s mostly irrelevant.

Excluding _Hitagi Throwing_ (where Kanbaru explains how she met Senjougahara in middle school), the earliest known story is _With Caution_ on March 26 (towards the beginning of _Koyomi Vamp_), and the latest known story is _Tsukihi Brushing_, that takes place after Araragi’s graduation.

## What’s next for this project?
As more stories will likely be released in the future (Nisio can’t stop writing, after all), and since we’d like to try and improve everything we can, we’re planning on publishing future editions of this book at some point. Look forward to it!
