It was only on the night after the meeting held in the living room of the Araragi house between the couple; Araragi Koyomi and Senjougahara Hitagi, and the Fire Sisters; Araragi Karen and Araragi Tsukihi, later to be known as “Gahara Summit” had ended, that Oshino Shinobu appeared, seeming rather displeased.

Shinobu, who despite being nocturnal by no means would always appear at night, did in fact appear as if it were the most normal thing.

Almost as if waiting for the exact moment when I decided to fall onto my bed with a sense of relief after more or less successfully making it through the actually extremely difficult meeting.

“Aaaah”

The tired-sounding voice came out of her mouth as she crawled out from the shadows.

What’s with that voice.

It’s like she wants me to pay attention to her.

“I could barely watch that. Pretending to be friends, pretending to be family. I hate that stuff the most.”

“Uuugh.”

Oh boy.

I’ve got another young lady with a “charming” personality on my hands now.

I never would have guessed that there’d be a bonus level after completing that serious discussion of ours.

“You can pretend it was so much trouble for you, but I saw you with that grin on your face trying to get the conversation going between your girlfriend and your sisters. Aaah, I can’t stand it, I simply can’t.”

Shinobu said, criticizing me not directly, but indirectly, disguising her rant as her talking to herself by shrugging and stretching out both of her arms in an overexaggerated motion.

Mumbling on and on, complaining on and on.

“To see the warrior who drove me so close to the edge grow so soft. Why don’t you just get your own soap opera already. You don’t belong in any youkai stories anymore. Go on spouting that tepid crap to those girls all you like.”

“You sure say some feisty things…”

And even during spring break I didn’t even do that much to her. Now she’s starting to make stuff up just to get at me.

“Aaah, I don’t even know anymoooore. I guess in the end your family and your girlfriend or whatever is more important to you after aaaall.”

Shinobu continued without even glancing my way. It almost seemed like she was just talking to herself, but loud enough that I would definitely be able to hear her. Like she was trying to implicitly say “Can you even call yourself a vampire doing all this?”.

“What was that again, I remember you saying something. That’s right, I remember you saying some really cool line. Man, that made my heart beat sooo fast. I can’t imagine someone who’d say they cared about their girlfriend or their family saying something that would get my heart beating sooo fast.”

“W—What are you talking about?”

“ ‘If you die tomorrow, I’m fine with my life ending tomorrow too’ or something, or were you just trying to sweet-talk me.”

Since she had answered my question, it seemed like she wasn’t just talking to herself after all. But still Shinobu refused to look my way.

“But from what I heard at that meeting you just had, it won’t matter whether I die. You’ll just go on living your normal life. I’m sure. 100%.”

“Well, actually Shinobu-san. That’s not true really…”

“Then die right here right now. I’m already dying from a disease right now so hurry up and die. You can’t? You can’t, can you. There you go, liar.”

“…”

Just like the 8-year-old she looked like.

But actually, this is kinda cute in its own way.

“Just listen to me, Shinobu. That’s not how it is. I know that maybe I was hard to watch today, but I wasn’t trying to ignore you.”

For some reason I started to try and cheer up Shinobu. I was forced to. Why did it end up like this.

“I thought it was obvious, your bond with me is the most precious thing in the world to me—”

“Ha, that’s what all men say when they’re cheating. Well fine! You must be the modern version of the main character in Life of an Amorous Man”[^1] 

“There’s no way you’ve heard of that book before. I bet you’re just guessing based on the name.”

Actually.

Even if you don’t know about the book, the title already tells you enough anyway.

I actually found it pretty interesting that Shinobu in her blond little girl state would know about the famous works of Ihara Saikaku.[^2] I wonder where all her knowledge even comes from.

Normally Shinobu just spends her time inside my shadow, and apparently it’s a pretty large space so she spends her time reading or playing games… I’m starting to wonder what kinds of books Shinobu reads.

“How about this, my master. If I, your girlfriend, your giant sister and your minuscule sister were all hanging from the side of a cliff and you could only save one of us, who would you save?”

“…”

She’s so goddamn annoying!

This little brat’s so goddamn annoying!

I felt myself straining under the weight of how annoying she was and said

“I don’t think I could make that choice. Everyone’s life is equal so there’s no way I could choose between them!”

trying to act cool while dodging the question by giving her lip service.

“Stop trying to act cool while dodging the question by giving me lip service.”

said Shinobu, evidently unsatisfied with my answer.

I don’t even know what to say after she just saw completely through my plan and threw it right back at my face…

“Answer me. Who would you pick? I might have to leave your shadow depending on your answer.”

“Can you even leave it…?”

“Of course I can. I just so happened to stumble into your shadow and started living there anyway. You could say I’m like Odysseus in Circe’s mansion.”[^3] 

“I guess that explains why you have all those books…”

In reality, those were just books she took from my bookshelf. But if there really was a bookshelf you could just keep taking from and there would always be more books, that would really be heaven to any bookworm. Anyway…

Hmm.

What should I do about this.

In any case, I should just tell her “Shinobu, obviously I’d save you even if I had to leave Senjougahara and Karen-chan and Tsukihi-chan behind, even if I had to use them as a shield, obviously I’d save you!” and get myself out of this question for now… But really.

When I’m already talking to someone with this kind of mindset, I’d really just be giving her lip service, or trying to act cool, or dodging the question… and then she’d see right through me—I mean throw a bunch of false accusations at me and say “Ha! You’re trying to sweet-talk me again!”

So, where does this leave me.

Well, there is only one model answer.

“I would reach out to”

I said.

I said with a posed look on my face.

“Hanekawa. Hanekawa Tsubasa. If I really was in that kind of situation, I’d reach out to Hanekawa—and ask for her help.”

“…”

Shinobu looked at me with an astounded look on her face for a little while, then afterwards

“Ka ka”

She began to laugh.

She finally laughed.

“Well if you mention her I guess I have to agree. It really is convenient for you to just pull out her name.”

But really that was just another way of getting myself out of the question, and in terms of who I save or don’t save, even if I get someone else’s help, in the end people can only save themselves, and people can never save other people. Maybe I wouldn’t be able to save any of the four, or five, of them, but at least for the time being I managed to stop Shinobu from leaving—and from then on just like before,

Shinobu would keep living in my shadow.
