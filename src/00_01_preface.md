# Preface

This translation project started in November 2015, when I discovered the existence of the short stories. I was eager to read more Monogatari while waiting for the anime to continue, but I was very disappointed when I saw that almost none of the stories had been translated into English. Surely, for a series as successful as Monogatari, the community must have done everything already, right? It turned out that it hadn’t, and the existence of the short stories itself wasn’t something widely known.

That’s when I had the idea to directly ask the \/r/araragi subreddit if people would be interested in translating these stories to share them with the English-speaking community. And fortunately, they were, and a couple of talented people joined me in this project! They are the people I want to publicly thank, because my only role here was to coordinate everything, send messages and find raws, and the real hard work was their doing! Their names are listed at the end of this book.

In addition, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Haremless who single-handedly translated or proofread half of the stories and has always been extremely reliable, and to bluex who helped me put this whole book together with superb editing skills. Without them, work on this project would not have come nearly this far, and making this book would not have been possible. I can’t thank them enough for their efforts.
And of course, thank you everyone else for the support!

With that out of the way, let’s start with the real content of this book.
