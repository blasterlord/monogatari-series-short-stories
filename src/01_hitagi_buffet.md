Usually I can easily see Senjougahara at school, but seldom do I have time to meet her on Sundays. But shockingly, we met up that day.

Having said that, it’s just that she got a free coupon from her father for a cake buffet that is for limited use on Sunday and she suddenly wanted to use it. It’s a dessert café that is too expensive for civilians, so in order for the shop to maintain its style, it usually does not take up such pirate-like behavior as buffets, but it seemed to be the shop’s anniversary that day.

Speaking of freely eating cakes, when I am standing in front of a counter full of donuts, I can’t promise that Shinobu won’t appear from my shadow. Of course, she has never come out in front of Senjougahara, and she has also never been moved by anything other than the donuts from Mister Donut (she basically doesn’t eat human food), so I can tentatively relax.

If there was any concern, it would be the store’s exterior. Boys seem to need a certain degree of courage in order to go in, which made me so angry I stiffened, but I needed to tolerate it.

Senjougahara’s mockery doesn’t bother me anymore, and the cakes themselves are rich and varied; also the taste is by far the best I have ever eaten, so I don’t care about anything else.

Hmm, delicious.

Even bigger things are trivial in front of all this food. The fact that humans are animals dominated by food—I suddenly felt I experienced that truth deeply.
No, it’s the same even for vampires.

“Senjougahara. Did you get fat?” I said.

Taking a break, I inadvertently said it.

Although I haven’t watched any comedy shows recently, I could still describe the image in the next instant, like throwing a party, a fancy cake flew towards my face.

I don’t know if it’s for the guests’ convenience in eating it or if it was just designed that way, but this piece of fancy cake was much smaller than imagined, it could be said that it was mini‑sized, so very luckily, my face and clothes were not dirtied: the cake was directly enveloped by my mouth.

It was a very direct method of eating.

“Huh? You said something that you shouldn’t have said? Araragi-kun.”

Senjougahara’s eyes opened very wide.

Her deadpan look was very frightening.

“Girls don’t get fat.”

“Oh…… Is that so?”

“Yes. Girls only grow.”

Senjougahara placed the fork in her hand and started exaggeratingly eating sections of the cake one after another.

“This is not getting fat, this is just growing.”

“……”

What an amazing explanation.

“If I keep eating lots and lots like this, then soon I will become two people.”

“Scary in many ways.”

That explanation is scary, having two of you is even more scary.

“Say, you were too thin before, so if you were to add a little bit of weight now, the extra flesh would be very obvious.”

“Don’t say the flesh will be very obvious.”

Senjougahara was poised, holding the fork.

In front of me, her boyfriend.

…… Something worth mentioning, if it were the Senjougahara from some time ago, then certainly, instead of throwing cake from the beginning, she would have mercilessly attacked me by directly throwing the fork at me. Realizing this point, I felt that she has calmed a lot from before.

But certainly I can’t say that she has become very gentle.

“Speaking to the end, Araragi-kun, talking about things like weight in front of a girl, those things are just too sensitive.”

“Ah.”

Actually that is right.

But seeing Senjougahara eating so happily, I was shocked even as I was drinking black tea, so I wanted to pull her down a notch.

On this steel-skin face, or rather steel-shell face, I wanted to reveal a little flaw in that face.

Basically, I wanted some mischief.

“Although I didn’t want to say it, but recently I have gained a little weight.”

“Hmm. So it’s actually true.”

I’d thought it was an illusion.

“Specifically about five kilograms.”

“By that much, what!?”

Five kilos!

Isn’t that the same as her weight when she was possessed by the crab?!

In this sense, it’s the addition of one person’s worth.

“What is wrong? It’s a popular scenario that’s been coming out lately.”

“No, that’s not the case. If it is the flesh that was coming out then it’s really frightening.”

“You’re really annoying. Be careful of me making your internal organs fly out.”

The visceral fats coming out.

I hate this kind of 3D effect.

Ah.

I can’t actually tell that she got fat…… But, ah, she gained a lot.

“So would it really be better if you returned to the track and field team? That way you can also stay in shape.”

“Well.”

Senjougahara really hates things about the past, especially things from middle school, but this time she didn’t refute, as if she were thinking deeply about something.

“Let me explain something.”

Senjougahara said, while eating cake.

“Being able to eat what you love like this, and also being able to eat until you’re full… Until a while ago this was unimaginable. That’s why I’m really happy.”

“Ah?”

“Think about it. Back then, because of the crab, I—didn’t have any weight. So, just like limiting the weight of my clothing, I also had to limit food intake.”

Eat too much—you’ll get heavy.

Senjougahara said.

“Ah……”

I nodded.

I see.

Because being overly thin—because of this kind of reason.

Ultimately, Senjougahara is considered tall among girls (she’s even taller than me). Even though she gained five kilograms, it actually probably is still far from reaching the standard weight.

“Being able to eat what you love until you’re full is great. Having a real sense of that love.”

Senjougahara repeated that continuously.

“When I love something, I will get a small feeling of being saved. Although, of course, I may be a person who has committed a lot of mistakes—but at least when I see something good is still something good, I still have this kind of emotion, so I am able to forgive myself a little.”

“Forgive—”

Being saved.

No—I can understand this point.

Saying I understood… It is better to say I have personally experienced it.

Perhaps, the opposite.

Only after you love something, can you feel like you’re being saved, or being forgiven. Only people like me and Senjougahara would have this kind of feeling—

“I like the me who is liking something, or you can say, in love with a girl in love. So, of course, this short phase has a denied meaning—but is there anything wrong?”

This is something from someone who has never hated herself—she said.

“That may be true…… But that can’t be a reason for overeating cake. Everything must have a limit.”

“That’s right.”

Senjougahara nodded, but her hands didn’t stop.

In the end, Senjougahara’s family’s economic condition has not recovered, so maybe there’s very little opportunity for her to eat this much.

But even if you say I’m crazy, I actually feel, slightly, that girls with a bit of meat are cuter; you can even say that I even want her to gain two more kilograms.

“So are you going to start jogging with Kanbaru?”

“Forget it. That weight loss method can’t be followed by ordinary people.”

“However, while talking, I found that Araragi-kun can really eat. I’m telling you in advance, Araragi-kun, if your BMI goes over 20, I will ruthlessly break up with you.”

“That benchmark is too strict.”

20\. That is even stricter than the metabolic syndrome.

“Ah, but that should be no problem.”

“You seem very confident. Why?”

“No, I only recently discovered it, but this can be regarded as one of the few physical advantages of vampires. A vampire’s specialty is the body being able to maintain a sound condition. If it goes over a certain value, it will naturally return to the optimum body weight. That is to say, I won’t get fat.”
Kala.

Senjougahara’s fork fell to the ground.

She bore a stunned expression—by the way, this kind of expression, I have never seen it before.

The expressionless attribute collapsed.

“No, but, this is just a side effect. Not as tight as like Kanbaru. So I can still get a bit fat. So, I’m still very jealous of that person—hmm, Senjougahara-san?”

“How enviable……”

I was harshly glared at.

“This kind of rule-breaking tactic, I will never accept it…… You have this kind of body, and also use this condescending view to judge my weight gain……”

“No, no, I’m not judging you.”

“OK, you will see. Araragi-kun who relies on oddities, I’ll let you see the possibility of human beings. The parts that I grew, I’ll lose it in an instant—I declare it here, Senjougahara weight loss plan activate.”

“Weight, weight loss plan……”

So it’s not losing fat? A gross exaggeration.

“Ah. I’ll start the fight immediately after I finish this meal!”

Senjougahara said, and used her hands to grab the cake, eating it mouthful by mouthful (because the fork just fell on the ground). Then, at an alarming rate she started eating the cake on my plate.

In short, initially, I even worried that she was going to finish up all the cake in that place, but seeing the expressionless her enjoying the mood of liking something, I did not want to pull her down anymore.

As long as Senjougahara is happy, even if I don’t eat cake, I will also feel happy.

I thought today was the best day.

…… By the way, as a follow-up story, after that Senjougahara really began training with Kanbaru together, and just like a joke, in a short amount of time she successfully lost weight.

Sure enough, you can not underestimate her perseverance.
