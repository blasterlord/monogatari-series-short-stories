“Ah, that’s good.”

“What is?”

As I let out a sigh of relief that I felt from the bottom of my heart, Oshino-san asked,

“Having seen ‘that’, can you really feel that way? Having seen that this sort of horrifying and terrible things exist in the world, can you really say that you have no doubts? If that’s the case it’s—unusual.”

“…………”

It’s not as if I didn’t understand what he was saying.

Terrible things. The spectacle unfolding before us was terrible—Araragi-kun has bitten the neck of Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade.

The human is eating the demon. The demon is eating the demon. The demon is eating the human.

Positioned in such a way that they appeared to be hugging, you could say that they almost looked as if they were unifying to become one, though in reality neither was the case—without either becoming human, they both simply ceased to be demons.

“But isn’t this alright? After all it is the ‘bad end’ that you suggested.”

“I’m at a loss, being told something like that as if it were obvious. It wasn’t obvious; it was practical. I simply suggested a plan as a professional. Even so, I’d intended to suggest other plans as well. Of all of them, Araragi-kun picked the most uncertain one. It’s a bit difficult for me to understand, frankly, but—as a pro it’s very important that you don’t complain about your customer’s choices.”

It wasn’t as if I were trying to act tough and bad-mouth him.

Oshino-san probably really is confused by Araragi-kun’s decision, and probably by Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade’s as well—it is fairly difficult to understand.

I’m not in any position to decide how would be best to handle this situation.

Even if I understood his feelings, I get the feeling that it wouldn’t do any good. But if it were me, what would I do?

Not now, but earlier when there was still room to make a different choice.

At the time that I went walking around faintly hoping that I might run into a vampire, if I’d encountered one who’d had all four limbs plucked off, what decision would I have made?

It’s not a question that seems like it’d lead to a pleasant conclusion.

Contrary to expectations, I might have promptly overlooked it…

I might’ve given up saying something like, “Well, it is the providence of nature, so there’s nothing that can be done about it” as I tossed away all of the stress that’s left a bad aftertaste in my mouth all this time. I won’t even consider what might happen if some stray cat were to eat that sort of illegally-dumped waste.

At the very least, the vampire that was near death, screaming and crying, probably couldn’t even have been saved by kindness.

“I wonder what will become of Araragi-kun now,” Oshino-san said in a cold tone.

“He made the choice not to exterminate a vampire—an enemy of mankind. What will become of Araragi-kun now that he’s made that choice. Won’t he just end up being abandoned by anyone and everyone? Won’t everyone give up on him? Probably no one—will end up helping him ever again.”

“…………”

They won’t help him; they’ll only lend their power.

People save themselves on their own—it seems that’s Oshino-san’s motto.

But now, the topic at hand was Araragi-kun’s future.

A girl with no weight, a girl who’s lost, a girl who earnestly wishes, a girl who’s a victim—Araragi-kun won’t be able to be saved by any of them.

A girl, a girl, a girl, and a girl?

Who am I talking about anyway? Is it some sort of parable? Or a metaphor?

Or maybe it’s Araragi-kun’s so-called “sort of thing you can see through”.[^1]

Right. Araragi-kun’s future as a person has been interrupted. With a snap. 

It seems that everyone will share the misery, and as expected the one who will become most unhappy, without complaint, is Araragi-kun—humanity has probably suffered the most harm and vampires have taken the greatest loss, so why must Araragi-kun suffer the greatest punishment?

Why, even though he’s done nothing wrong?

Even though he couldn’t have abandoned her.

Even though he couldn’t have given up on her.

Even though he only tried to help her—even though he wasn’t able to help her.

“I don’t know what will happen to Araragi-kun from here on out, but,”

I said, without a determined nuance. 

I said it the same as I always do.

“I’ll do something. Somehow.”

“…… Something’s wrong with you,”

Oshino-san said as he returned his unlit cigarette to his mouth.

Did you know?

I don’t know everything, I only know what I know.

And that was something that I still didn’t know. 

I might have something wrong with me. I might be in love.
