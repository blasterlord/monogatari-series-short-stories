Lucy Maud Montgomery is well known as the author of Anne of Green Gables, but this morning let’s talk about something “blue” instead of something “red” like Anne’s hair.[^2] In other words, we’ll be talking about the story starring Valancy Stirling, The Blue Castle.

“Have you read it before? Araragi-san.”

“The Blue Castle? Actually Hachikuji, I’m sorry for being a bad student, but I’ve never even heard of this book until just now.”

Araragi-san replied after thinking for a few moments. Anne of Green Gables is just so famous that not many people would recognize The Blue Castle here in Japan in any case.

“I’m a bit embarrassed to admit it, but out of Montgomery’s works I’ve only read Anne of Green Gables. I think Senjougahara’s only read Chronicles of Avonlea even with her habit of reading anything and everything.”

“What kind of reader is she?”

I guess there are all sorts of weird indiscriminate readers out there.

I began to explain the plot of The Blue Castle to Araragi-san.

“So the protagonist is a 29-year-old woman named Valancy Stirling with a power of imagination you could say rivals even Anne Shirley.”

“Wouldn’t it be pretty bad to have an imagination like Anne Shirley at 29…?”

“One day Miss Stirling is told by her doctor that she only has one year left to live, and the story follows how a woman who has been oppressed by her family and relatives for her entire life chooses to live out the remainder of her life.”

I ignored Araragi-san’s comment. (It would be quite bad though, in reality.) Anyway, this isn’t a book review so I’ll stop there for the introduction. (I also won’t explain why the title of the book is The Blue Castle.) I decided to ask Araragi-san a question.

“What would you do if you were told that you only had one year left to live, Araragi-san?”

“What? What do you mean?”

“I suppose you’re always one wrong move from dying tomorrow, but what I’m asking is what you would do if you could survive for an entire year.”

“That has a completely different gist to it. Hmm”

I wonder—Araragi-san said with his arms crossed. One of the nice things about him is that he’ll always at least consider any question I ask him. Being so very impressed by his laudable actions (that was a lie, just in case) I gave him a few suggestions.

“Like travelling around the world, or going on a shopping spree, or confessing to someone who you’ve always loved, there are lots of things you could say.”

“I do definitely get that feeling of not wanting to leave with any regrets but hmm… Actually, I might not do anything.”

“You wouldn’t do anything?”

I wasn’t expecting that answer. I wonder if he was just trying to say something different to get attention. I hate that sort of mentality of always wanting to show off one’s appeal with a burning passion, so I immediately cut in.

“Doesn’t that just mean you’ve given up on everything? Does that mean if all you’ve got left is one year, and no matter what you do it’s all pointless, that in a way you’ve fallen into complete despair? You really are too self-conscious.”

“That’s not what I mean. Like, when you’re alive it’s just all things that you need to do. I mean as long as you’re alive there’s always going to be some activities you can’t avoid.”

“Activities. Do you mean doing work?”

“Not just work, even ‘playing’ or ‘resting’ are just activities you have to do to live. In order to live tomorrow you have to eat a nice meal and sleep well, but if I only had one year left to live I’d be free from all those sorts of responsibilities.”

“Hmm”

In the end there’s not much of a difference from just falling into despair and giving up, in my opinion. That’s what I would say, but he does have a point. And even a journey of a thousand miles has to start from a point.[^3] And like he said, being able to do nothing at all might be the greatest luxury to an organism. Chasing your dreams. Looking for hope. Shooting for your targets. Those might seem like nice and positive examples of self-actualization but they all require quite an amount of hard work and effort in exchange.

But in fact because of the little time remaining in your life, you wouldn’t have to travel the world, you wouldn’t have to go on a shopping spree, you wouldn’t have to confess to that person you’ve always loved. That line of thought could warrant some consideration.

“As long as we’re alive, we must try to bring ourselves the greatest amount of pleasure possible, so wouldn’t it be nice to be free from that burden on our lives, at least at the end? Wouldn’t it be nice to not have to do all the things that we want? You get tired after a while. You get tired of having to enjoy every moment of your life in this world all the time.

He sure talks like he knows everything there is to know. But it is like him to say that with all the deaths he’s experienced.

I felt a little warm on the inside.

“By the way Hachikuji. I know you said that this morning we’d be talking about something ‘blue’ instead of something ‘red’, but if we’re talking about Anne of Green Gables wouldn’t that be ‘green’?”

Says the person who apologized for being a bad student.

I feel like that warm feeling inside me was all for nothing.

“You know in Japanese sometimes we use the word ‘blue’ instead of ‘green’,[^4] but in the end it’s talking about the same thing. I think you should apologize and correct yourself.”

I wanted to punch him.

“Come on… It’s not a big deal really, you could say that the future for a company looks ‘black’ if they’re ‘in the red’.[^5] You’re always like this, getting all worked up over the little details, 1/f yuragi-san.”[^6]

“Don’t talk about someone like a healing wave[^7] or something. Apologize for that and correct it too. My name is Araragi.”

I see.

I guess I’ll have you live for a bit longer, or quite a while longer, and enjoy life without complaining. So I, Hachikuji Mayoi, prayed that you, Araragi-san, would have a long life, then returned to our usual exchange.

“Sorry, I stuttered.”

[^1]: Play on the popular saying “Pain, pain, fly away” that parents say to little kids, with “pain” (いたいの, itai no) replaced with “innocence” (いたいけ, itaike).

[^2]: Anne of Green Gables in Japanese is 赤毛のアン (akage no an, “Red Haired Anne”).

[^3]: Hachikuji quotes a slightly different version of the saying “A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step” where “a single step” is replaced by “a single mile”. She makes a pun with 一理 (ichiri, “one point”) and 一里 (ichiri, “one mile”).

[^4]: Japanese, like many other languages, traditionally did not distinguish between the colors we know as “green” and “blue” and used a single term (青, ao) to refer to both. There is a word (緑, midori) that means specifically “green” but is not generally used in situations where this distinction is not needed. “Go” traffic signals and vegetables are 青 but green paint is 緑.

[^5]: The original compares two words for a baby: 赤ちゃん (akachan) with the word for “red” (赤, aka) in it, and 嬰児 (midorigo) with the word for “green” (嬰, midori).

[^6]: The gi in yuragi is written the same as in Araragi (阿良々木) as 木 as opposed to the normal ぎ. See also the next note.

[^7]: 1/f ゆらぎ (1/f yuragi) or “1/f noise”, also known as “pink noise”, is often (unscientifically) thought to have calming effects in Japan and is marketed as such in a variety of household electronics.
