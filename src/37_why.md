Is it alright if I tell one occasionally?

It’s a collector of monster stories telling stories about monsters.[^1]

It happened on the first day of spring break… Hmm, although, since it’s been so long since I became an adult, I don’t really have much of a concept of “spring break” myself, and as someone who’s never really worked, the concept of spring break is even more foreign. And so, what I mean is that it was the first day of spring break for a certain high school student in that town that I aimlessly stopped at.

I saw something strange. It’s my job to see strange things.

You asked why it was a vampire? Well that’s only half-right. Why was it the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire? Well now that’s half-justice, isn’t it? 

What I saw was the image of the iron-blooded, hot-blooded, cold-blooded vampire in the form of a young child, dragging the body of a certain high schooler. She was dragging that dead-looking boy like he was a giant turnip or something. Ever since I met Gaen-senpai back when I was a college student, which is to say well before seeing this, I’d had spiritual experiences that had piled up like a sacred mountain, but, well, seeing as strange a sight as that was totally unprecedented. 

It was obviously hard work. Well, it was probably more like torture than work.

That certain high schooler had a small build, but even so it was obvious that it was fairly hopeless, as it was beyond the little girl’s strength—seemingly unconscious, it looked as though his skin might be grated off as he was being pulled along the surface of the road.

All the same, the girl seemed to have no intention of parting with that certain high schooler. Gripping to him like life itself, as if he were a part of her own body, she continued to stubbornly drag him along.

I more or less understood what happened.

However, I hadn’t at all anticipated that it would turn out like this—Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, whose heart I’d pulled out for the sake of fairness, would likely either beat the alliance of vampire extermination experts made up of Dramaturgy, Episode, and Guillotine Cutter or lose to them. 

The outcome would either be a future where she lived or one where she died.

But to think that there would be a future where she was shamelessly saved by a mere high schooler while on the verge of death, and then go as far as transforming herself into a child to survive.

Honestly, I can’t think that she’s a demon who wants to live when she went as far as taking that form—if anything, I think she’s a demon that wants to die.

For that reason I removed her heart, and for that reason this situation came about. 

Obviously, on principle I can’t make any concessions about the fact that I tried to create a balance in the fight between a single vampire and three vampire hunters, but seizing Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade’s heart was also in order to balance her between life and death.

The suicidal desire shut up in the right ventricle, the survival instinct sealed within the left ventricle, the death wish confined to the right atrium, and the metabolism lurking in the left atrium, I reset them all to zero in one go.

I’d intended to free her from the hundreds of years’ worth of ties that had built up within her chest—naturally, out of kindness. Or out of pity.

If there’s anything I pay respect to, it’s time. And if there’s anywhere I aim my hostility, that would be time as well. This legendary vampire, this historical vampire, I’d wanted her to draw conclusions based on the present—even so, why did it turn out like this?

Why?

There’s no reason. There’s no way it should have happened.

A dude just passing through removed her heart, but it was a passing high schooler that pierced it.

For the sake of her benefactor, awkwardly and unreasonably, she’s shamelessly trying to live—as a result, not knowing how he would feel, seeking distress rather than ease and humiliation over dignity from the benefactor who saved a vampire while not knowing her true nature.

Haha, how foolish. Though I am moved.

I’m not lying, I’m being serious.

I’m not making this up, I’m telling you a true story.

As evidence, I approached the vampire dragging along a certain high schooler—approached her and said.

Not in order to help her, but to keep things moving along.

Not so that she’d keep living, but so that she’d keep dying.

Not in order to exterminate her.

In order to cut off her retreat.

“Are you being chased, Heart-Under-Blade? If you are, I know of a good place to hide.”

It’d be nice if, at least once, something nice could happen in her old age for this princess who never lost her heart, even now when she’s lost her heart.[^2]

It’d be nice for her to face death without regrets.

[^1]: The word used for “collector” is 蒐集家 (shuushuuka). Normally, one would write collector as 収集家 (shuushuuka). The version used in the story implies that the collecting is done either out of interest or for research rather than simply gathering things up as the normal writing would imply. Also, the kanji used contains 鬼 (oni, “demon”) as a radical, making it a bit of a visual pun.

[^2]: For the first instance of “heart”, he says 心 (kokoro) which means “heart” in a metaphorical sense (like “from the bottom of my heart”, “broke my heart”, etc.). The second “heart” is 心臓 (shinzou), the actual organ itself.
