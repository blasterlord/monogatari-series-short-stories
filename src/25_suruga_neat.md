“Have you heard of Mary Hastings Bradley’s Alice in Jungleland, my beloved daughter, Kanbaru Suruga-chan?”

“I doubt you have”, my awful mother, Kanbaru Tooe-san, continued with a malicious, smirking laugh. Of course, although I unfortunately didn’t know anything about that book, not being very well read, what I wanted to know is why she, who should have passed away long ago in a traffic accident, now seemed to have come back to mock me like this.

Well, I suppose this is a dream.

That we can’t choose the dreams we have might be the greatest flaw of the creatures known as humans—is that something like how a child can’t choose the parents that they’re born to?

“…… I wonder, is Alice in Jungleland a variation on Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland? I was sure that that book had a sequel called Through the Looking Glass……”[^3]

“No, no, that’s why I said that the author of Alice in Jungleland was Mary Hastings Bradley—she was an American author and an explorer at the same time. It’s a record of when she went on an adventure with her family into the interior of Africa.”

“I see. So it’s a true story?”

“Yes, but although I say it’s a true story, since it was written nearly a century ago, naturally you’ll feel a bit of the period coming through in its depictions. The title is Alice in Jungleland because Bradley’s 6-year-old daughter who came with them was named Alice, and the book is written from her point of view.”

“Oh……”

I couldn’t give a clear answer because I’ve never read anything by Mary Hastings Bradley, much less her daughter, so I really don’t have much interest in either of them. Still, my mother is quite the eccentric. She should have just brought up Lewis Carroll.

“Hahaha. No, no, when I was a girl, Lewis Carroll was my favorite thing to read. I read The Hunting of the Snark[^4] so many times!”

“Why The Hunting of the Snark? I’d expect Alice in Wonderland to be first.”

“I read Alice in Wonderland quite a few times, too. Although, the one I read was Alice Monogatari, which was translated in collaboration by Akutagawa Ryuunosuke[^5] and Kikuchi Kan.”[^6]

“Please read Alice in Wonderland normally…”

At least read The Nursery “Alice”.[^7]

I read The Red House Mystery just because it was the only mystery written by the author of Winnie the Pooh, and while substance is important, even I’m drawn to the events surrounding this book. I don’t plan on insisting that I’m a serious reader myself, but to hear the story like this leads me to believe that, without a doubt, it’s because of my mother’s influence that I read it—after all, don’t they say that children grow up watching their parents’ backs?

“Humph. Children watch their parents’ backs… In other words, parents turn their backs on their children—if that’s the case, Suruga, in order to get your interest, I’ll disclose some valuable information. I was surprised to find this out later myself, but the Alice whose point of view this story is told from, the 6-year-old girl who’s shown riding on the back of a baby elephant at the beginning of the book, went on to become James Tiptree Jr,[^8] the giant of the sci-fi novel world who wrote The Only Neat Thing to Do.”

“J—junior!?”

No.

I shouldn’t be focusing on the “junior”.

James Tiptree Jr. Naturally, even I know her—she’s an author whose books I’ve read. Instead, I want to know if there’s anyone who hasn’t read her books. The Only Neat Thing to Do was a book Senjougahara-senpai and I were quite fond of in middle school.

“Ha, in any case, people like you probably read it because it was a temporary title for the series finale of Neon Genesis Evangelion.”

“You’re right but, if you say that, doesn’t it mean that you only read Alice in Jungleland because James Tiptree Jr appears in it as a child? Why say ‘I was surprised to find out later’? Please stop lying.”

“Incidentally, I’ve read the version of The Only Neat Thing to Do that was illustrated by Kawahara Yumiko.[^9] Aren’t you jealous?”

Even though you’re innocently bragging……

That might just be a difference of the times, though.

“So that means that both mother and daughter were authors, huh? In fact, wasn’t it kept a secret for a long time that James Tiptree Jr was a woman?”

“Yes. Well, sometimes choosing the same career as your mother leads to conflict. How much do you know, Suruga, about Tiptree’s heroic life as an author?”

“To an extent, but I couldn’t give details.”

The fact that she was having adventures in Africa at the age of 6 already seems too amazing to call it just an anecdote, but even without knowing that, the story of James Tiptree Jr’s life is breathtaking. My mother said her “life as an author”, but I think it would be more accurate to say her life in general. She was the kind of author an eccentric reader like myself, interested not only in an author’s books, but also the little anecdotes regarding their life, couldn’t talk about without going on and on. Specifically, as far as her death goes, it’d be best to quietly keep my mouth shut.[^10]

“But, it feels odd. No, if you say it’s natural then it’s natural, but… Well… Even the great authors in science fiction history, and, well, literary history, were children once, and they had parents, too.”

Everyone was a child once.

And everyone is someone’s child.

Never mind being “natural”, it’s life’s major premise—but, if it’s unexpected, you’re liable to lose sight of it, like something totally ordinary. So, it’s a story that’s not just limited to “great authors”.

Oneself—myself.

I don’t think that I can really remember what it was like when I was that young, and it’s hard to say that I’m constantly focusing on whose child I am.

“What was important to you as a child becomes less and less important. The things that you used to think were amazing become ordinary clichés. Family should be everything, but becomes just another part of the world. A mother’s love that envelops you like a vast sea is a narrow well—in all honesty, if that’s what it means to grow up, there’s something really lonely in that.”

“…… I don’t have any memory at all of you ‘enveloping me in a mother’s love’……”

“That’s because you’ve forgotten.”

“………”

I wonder if that’s true…

“Just like you, I was once a child too, and I also forgot the time when my parents were raising me. All I remember is the books I read.”

“The Hunting of the Snark?”

“Among others. Which books you’ve read and at what age, it’s very important, don’t you think? With people and with books, in the end, the time you encounter them is everything.”

“… But there are times when we forget the books that we’ve read.”

I didn’t like the feeling of her lecturing me without saying anything back, so as a token effort, I made a rebuttal—although, it is the truth in its own way. Indiscriminate readers like Senjougahara-senpai and I, who read books like drinking water, completely forget the books we read a long time ago and end up reading the same ones two or even three times.

“It’s fine if that’s the case, isn’t it? While the things that were important to you as a child might become less important—those books that you used to think were neither good nor bad might become interesting when you’ve grown up.”

“I wonder. That might be true, but I wonder if that means that I’ve matured as a reader.”

I guess if you say that the timing of the encounter is important, it will be. Then, my mother shrugged her shoulders.

“Well, perhaps, the books might be the ones maturing—in this case, maybe it should be ‘aging’ rather than ‘maturing’.”

“Aging…?”

“The radical travel diary written one hundred years ago, as a result of the author’s daughter becoming a great author afterwards, now shines in a different light. You need to follow that example, too. It might be The Only Neat Thing to Do for you.

In short.

My mother, Kanbaru Tooe, laughed with a grin and said,

“If you can’t be medicine, be poison. Otherwise, you’re just plain water.”

[^1]: A saying meaning that the hard, bitter truth is the best medicine.

[^2]: 二輪挿し (nirinzashi) means penetration of one hole with two objects which relates to Kanbaru's affinity for BL.

[^3]: The Japanese titles literally translate to Alice of the Jungle Country, Alice of the Strange Country, and Alice of the Mirror Country respectively, which explains a bit more of Kanbaru’s confusion.

[^4]: The Hunting of the Snark is a nonsense poem published by Lewis Carroll in 1876, five years after Through the Looking Glass.

[^5]: Akutagawa Ryuunosuke (1892-1927) was a famous short story author, best known in the West for his 1915 short story, 羅生門 (Rashoumon).

[^6]: Kikuchi Kan (1888-1948) was the pen name of Kikuchi Hiroshi (written using the same kanji, 菊池 寛), a well-known author and playwright who focused his stories on the hardships and daily lives of common people.

[^7]: The Nursery “Alice” is a shortened and revised version of Alice in Wonderland written by Lewis Carroll in 1890 for children under the age of five.

[^8]: James Tiptree Jr (1915-1987) is the pen name of science fiction author Alice Bradley Sheldon (née Hastings Bradley), daughter of Mary Hastings Bradley. To avoid confusion, I’m using female pronouns to refer to her while talking about Tiptree even though James is a male name, since Sheldon herself was a woman.

[^9]: Kawahara Yumiko (1960-?) is a shoujo manga artist best known for her Dolls (観用少女, Kan You Shoujo) series.

[^10]: On May 19, 1987 Sheldon (Tiptree) committed suicide. She had been suffering from health issues caused by a lifetime of smoking and her husband was nearly blind, invalid, and no longer able to care for himself. She shot and killed her husband in his sleep before turning the gun on herself.
