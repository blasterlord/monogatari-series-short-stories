Senjougahara Hitagi had been deceiving. As for what she’d been deceiving, the answer would be everything—everything and everyone around her, for two years. She had been hiding the curse that had befallen her, the condition she had been suffering from, all that time. I can’t help but think about what that must have been like. Of course, I’m not an especially honest person either. I’m an adolescent high schooler who lives his life lying just like anybody else, somehow managing to get along. But I end up wondering precisely because I’m that kind of person, what it must be like to deceive, to continue to trick everything and everyone, to keep on lying no matter what.

“If anything, won’t you have to do that from now on, Araragi-kun? After all, you’ll have to hide the fact that you’re a vampire—not just for two years, but the rest of your life.” Senjougahara answered.

Class had already ended and there was no one but us in the classroom.

The classroom was deserted—I’d forgotten how I’d come to ask that question. Anyhow, Senjougahara had, quite unusually, neither dodged the question nor resorted to her usual verbal abuse.

“Well, you’re right… That’s why I wanted to ask you about this.”

“You wanted to ask. Me. About how to lie?”

“Ummm…”

That was essentially what it was when you broke it down but putting it that way would mean calling Senjougahara Hitagi a liar, and that was just too blunt.

“I don’t think humans are very honest creatures,” I answered, doing my best to mince my words.

“But it’s clear that you build up stress by lying in any kind of relationship, right? I don’t know how to say it, you feel guilty, you have a nagging conscience… What I want to ask is, how do you put up with those sorts of feelings? Don’t people fundamentally not want to lie? Isn’t that why they phrase things so they just barely don’t count as lies, or lie as little as possible?”

“If there’s anything I can teach you as a master of lies—it’s that tricking people and deceiving people are similar, but not identical things. You shouldn’t lump those two words together, or say them in the same breath.” Senjougahara said.

Even though I had just changed the topic to something anyone could agree with, Senjougahara threw my consideration completely out the window. It seemed like she was in a good mood today. Well, seeing as this was what she was like when she was in a good mood, she was pretty hard to deal with as a classmate, but…

“Araragi-kun, do you have some small change?”

“Small change?”

Senjougahara sighed.

“You might even consider a 1000-yen bill small change coming from your family background, but I’m talking about coins.”

“My family isn’t that rich…”

Well, I knew I had some coins in my coin purse at least… I took out my wallet and gave Senjougahara a 100-yen coin.

“Thanks.”

“……………”

“……………”

“……………”

“……………”

“Hey. I’m not letting you have it! Give it back, OK? Didn’t you want to use it for something?”

“Let’s make a bet, Araragi-kun.” said Senjougahara nonchalantly, her fingers playing with my 100-yen coin.

“Heads or tails—front or back. A coin toss. If heads comes up, I get the 100 yen. If tails comes up, I’ll become your slave for the rest of my life.”

“Why are the stakes so high!?”

I don’t want to do that!

I don’t want to gamble with someone who’d bet their freedom over their body on a coin toss, let alone only for 100 yen!

“Are you Two-Face or something? Don’t stake your life on the side of a coin.”

“Two-Face. Quite an admirable villain.”

She spoke like she was a villain herself. What kind of heroine is she?

“Don’t worry about it. I just want to trick you, as an example… You better use this as reference for your pitiful life.”

“My pitiful life…”

Why do I have to be spoken to like this? Or was this her strategy, to goad me into taking the bet? Well, no, Senjougahara is always like this, so it’s not like she’s provoking me here in particular… Maybe because she’s in a good mood today, she really does think my life is pitiful.

“Trick me, huh?”

That means she’s clearly trying to cheat in this gamble of a coin toss, right? But how does she expect to trick me in such a simple bet when the coin isn’t even weighted? Since she’s pretty good with handling stationery, I’d expect Senjougahara to be rather dexterous… But I doubt she could manipulate the sides of the coin like a magician.

Hm. I’m a little intrigued.

“OK, I’m in.”

“Ha. What a pervert. You exposed your rotten nature.”

“No, wait, what I’m interested in is just how you’re going to deceive me, OK? I’m not interested in you wanting to become a slave or anything!”

“The maggots in your brain seem interested.”[^1]

Senjougahara quickly prepared the coin toss. I checked one more time—drawing up some defenses against her, her having almost announced that she’s going to pull some trick, probably is something like good manners in this kind of situation.

“You’re not going to switch out the coin I gave you with another one, are you?”

“Hmph. I don’t have any 100-yen coins I could exchange it with. Don’t underestimate my poverty.”

Those were heavy words.

“Let’s decide this so that we don’t argue about it later. The side with the numbers is the front. Is that alright?”

“Yeah, that’s OK.”

Strictly speaking, there is supposed to be a properly defined front and back for coins, but I didn’t know which was which. I don’t really remember which was the front and which was the back of a postcard, either… If I had to recall it, with both coins and postcards, it was the exact opposite of what you’d normally think. Well, the probability is fifty-fifty, so it doesn’t really matter.

“Well then, let’s start.” said Senjougahara before flipping the coin with her thumb—the coin which her life (meaninglessly) depended on, all too easily. I really don’t know what kind of nerves she has—at least judging from the way she flipped the coin, there was no apparent scheme or intention behind it.

Senjougahara Hitagi didn’t stop the 100 yen with her hands. She let the coin fly straight up then drop on the desk. If there was any way to cheat in a truly innocent coin toss, it would be to manipulate the position of the coin inside your hand after catching it. But at least Senjougahara didn’t do that.

The 100-yen coin lost its momentum and dropped flat on the table after spinning on it for a short time.

In other words, it didn’t come to the unlikely kind of conclusion that’d be expected in this kind of situation—the coin not falling over, standing on its rim. But in the end, an unexpected side did show itself.

The side with the picture of cherry blossoms was up.

In short, it was the back side.

“… Wait, what”

I shook my head, even though I was the winner.

What was up with this sloppy, meaningless unfolding of events?

“What were you trying to do, Senjougahara? Didn’t you just lose?”

“What are you talking about? I won, didn’t I?”

Senjougahara said that, confidently, unconcerned, without changing her expression.

She didn’t at all appear to be intimidated—that wasn’t the face of someone who had come to be my slave for the rest of her life. Rather, she acted like a queen.

“Look. Isn’t the front side up? We decided before that if heads comes up I win, right?”

“What?”

I looked at it again. Was I mistaken? I thought that, being a well-meaning person, but it was still the same side as before, the side with the cherry blossoms.

“What? What? Do you want to turn this into an argument about whether you did or didn’t say it? ‘I said that the side with the cherry blossoms was the front’, something like that? You don’t really mean to say that was your trick, right? I don’t accept that. You did say that the side with the numbers was the front.”

“That’s right. I said the side with numbers on it is the front—and that’s why I won, Araragi-kun.”

Then, Senjougahara… brought her index finger close to the 100 yen on the table, as if beginning some kind of séance.[^2] But she didn’t touch it. Her finger stopped just above it. While holding her finger there, she said:

“Don’t you see them? The numbers, I mean.”

“……………”

Looking again, there really were numbers written there—beneath the cherry blossom motif. “100 Yen”, written in small letters.

Of course it was not handwritten. Just like “Japan” was written above the blossoms—it was impressed there.

“On coins, there are numbers on both sides. So if you bet on the side with the numbers in a coin toss, you’ll always win.” Senjougahara said, then quickly picked up the 100 yen.

I was dumbfounded. Well, that was a blind spot. To be honest, I hadn’t really been aware of the fact that there were numbers there. But thinking about it now—the face value was impressed not only on the 100-yen coin, but also on the 1, 10, and 500-yen—in large font on one side, and small font on the other side. Even the 5-yen coin, which only has the face value impressed on one side, has the year it was minted impressed on the other side.

But…

Can she really say she deceived me with this?

“Isn’t it obvious? It didn’t come to an argument of whether you said one thing or the other, but it’s clear as day that you tricked!”

“I’m fine with that. That’s what it means to trick, not to deceive.”

After talking about how it was convenient that the cherry blossoms had come up on the first try—she really didn’t know if she should consider herself lucky or not—Senjougahara said:

“In the end, my trick when it comes to lying skillfully, Araragi-kun… is to not care if the lie gets exposed.”

Everyone wants to become a good person.

Everyone wants to be a good person.

Because of that, they patch things up so that the lie doesn’t come to light. But if you give up on that…

Humans can lie as much as they want.

“The goal of lying is to make yourself feel good, not to deceive others.

That’s why in order to make yourself feel good, no matter what the other person feels, no matter how he may think about you, you just don’t care. If you don’t decide clearly whether you want to be a good person or you want to feel good, then you end up somewhere in between. What do you think? Was that helpful?” said Senjougahara, flipping the coin one more time.

Not up in the air, but at me.

I caught it.

“Well, it helped me, but…”

I looked at the 100-yen coin in my hand, while thinking “Well, there’s no way I could live like that”—that is, while saying that it didn’t help me at all, I asked her. Wondering about how she had learned how to lie this way by 18 and whether she’d been taught by anybody.

“Are you fine with giving me this back?”

“Yes. In front of you, Araragi-kun, I think I feel better when I’m a good person. With you, Araragi-kun” she said toneless, without any emotion whatsoever, like always,

“I want to build a relationship without front or back side.”

No.

She may have put emotion into that.

[^1]: Both when Araragi speaks about his interest in the gamble and Senjougahara talks about the “maggots in his brain”, the verb 湧く (waku) is used, which has the meanings “to rise up, to well up, to appear” among others. So, while Araragi talks about his arising interest in the subject, Senjougahara talks about metaphorical maggots emerging from his “rotten mind”.

[^2]: In Japanese, the term こっくりさん (kokkuri-san) is used here. It’s something close to table-turning where you put a coin on a sheet of paper with numbers and answers like “yes” and “no” written on it. Then everyone puts their index finger on the coin and recites the phrase “Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san, please come here”. After that, the coin is supposed to “move on its own” by some spiritual influence and show the answer to some question.
